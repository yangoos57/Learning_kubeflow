4,"I stalk this truck.  I've been to industrial parks where I pretend to be a tech worker standing in line, strip mall parking lots, and of course the farmer's market.  The bowls are so so absolutely divine.  The owner is super friendly and he makes each bowl by hand with an incredible amount of pride.  You gotta eat here guys!!!"
2,"who really knows if this is good pho or not, i was hung tha fuck over and in desperate need of pho therapy. :P but it totally hit the spot and came out super freakin fast!!! omg! aaahhhhh.....\n\ni'm pretty sure it wasn't bad pho tho...meat, noodles, broth, all a-ok. the coffee was good too. thought i was gettin ripped off for a $3 cup of coffee but they gave me a big cup so it's all good! :)\n\nima make pho a must the next time i go to vegas again fo sure!!! yum! :D"
4,"I LOVE Bloom Salon... all of their stylist are very qualified and provide excellent hair care...I prefer to book my appointments with Andrea, but if she is not available I am not afraid to book with anyone else.  Not only does this salon provide hair care, but they also offer skin, nails and massage therapy!!  What a great place with a relaxing atmosphere...I HIGHLY recommend this place."
0,"We were excited to eat here, it is difficult to find. They were closed at 3 p.m. on a Saturday."
2,"So this is a place, with food. That much cannot be denied. But you know what? It's a small airport restaurant, and if you're flying in for a $100 hamburger, then a $100 hamburger you can have. And patty melts. And salads. And whatever other Sysco-type delights you might expect. (It was even prime rib night when we were there, but as it was 20 minutes til closing time, I thought better of it.)\n\nI had a perfectly reasonable patty melt myself, and I enjoyed it. The service was really nice, and the views out the window of the evening traffic on approach were phenomenal. Plus, *tons* of model airplanes hanging from the ceiling in the dining area, which was a fun touch."
2,"Review for the Lounge/Club:\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \n\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \n\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \n\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \n\nFor the Restaurant:\n\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price."
3,"I've been going here a lot(pretty much a regular you could say.) It's a good place to include in your bar hopping plans. Wandos too busy? Fooseball taken at Vintage? Swing by Red Shed. It's also one of the few bars you can actually have a conversation at some  nights. One of my minor complaints is the jukebox. If there is no songs playing..it's just that--quiet. And at certain points in the night, you can hear a pin drop. Lines for the bathroom is sometimes annoying and I've felt really bad for the ladies here who have sometimes waited 30 minutes before the line moved one person :P"
0,"I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \""all at once\"" so the flavors have little or no chance to \""marry up\"" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \""reserve\"" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \""building\"" of the paella\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\n\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\n\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\n\nRegardless of all this.  Common courtesy is something that I expect from any restaurant.  This place comes up short on just about every thing."
0,"Went in on a sunday afternoon. Place was dead. Wasn't greeted, sat at a table and was not helped. Waited 10 minutes, still no service. Walked out and still heard nothing from staff. \n\nIf time and service are important to you stay away from Hob Nob."
4,"I have lived here in Phoenix for 9 months now and have had a tough time finding a hair salon as I have thick, curly hair. I have been buying groupons for many places trying them out and none have worked. I bought the groupon for The Green Room to try it out and am absolutely in love with them! \n\nSteph was my stylist and she was amazing! I came in with a specific color I wanted as I will be leaving for two out of town weddings this month and she consulted the owner to make sure I got the right color. They would not let me leave until my color was perfect (my cut was amazing as well)! Eric (the owner) even took time to blow dry my hair after Stephanie's next client came.\n\nI will definitely be going back in the future for cuts and colors. The place was cute and cozy and the staff was super friendly. They definitely made me feel like they cared about me and what I wanted where the other salons just put a color on and let me go. So glad I found them and have found my new salon!"
0,"Totally gone down the tube. Way overpriced for food out of a box. Deserts are dry, old and inedible. Meat is like boot leather. The oysters stunk of dead fish. Plus just like the Paradise Buffet at Freemont, they were stuck to the shell. Very old.\n   Wait staff was as rude as they come. Wanted a 20% gratuity for my party of 8. This is a BUFFET dang it. WE get our OWN FOOD. Then they seated us 4 to a table across the room from each other. The buffet had 15 people in it. They did this out of spite. Stay away."
4,I look forward to every visit! I always get exactly what I ask for.  I prefer the more natural look and she always delivers! I enjoy my many compliments but always give her the credit she deserves. She is a beautiful artist who makes me feel beautiful too. Thanks!!
3,"There were three of us. Atmosphere was great. Menu was confusing on what to share, what to do. Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing. \n\nThe other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well. \n\nGlass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.\n\nFinal bill was approx $60 each."
1,"Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.   To sum up, it would be a nice place for a date, but I won't be back and I know a place not to far from there that I would MUCH rather go to given the choice."
3,the food is awesome... but the hostess are not nice....
0,"Got this \""deal\"" on Travel Zoo for $135 - \""normally $220.\""  A horrible joke.  Supposedly a five course meal.  I think the total weight of items served must have been about 8 ounces.  The carpaccio only covered a quarter of the plate, the \""scallops\"" consisted of a single scallop each!!  The pear for desert was about the size of a small tangerine.  I've never seen a ripe pear that small! They brought out covered plates in order for us not to be shocked until they removed the cover.  Should have asked for a magnifying glass to find the food on the plate.  It was like the Mad Hatter's Tea Party - it was hilarious.  If it wasn't for the bread and butter we would have starved.  Of course drinks are not included.  To add insult to injury you get an additional $35 bill tacked on for service, tip, and tax.  Would have preferred a gourmet meal at MacDonalds.  I almost forgot to mention this place has all the ambiance of a restroom.  No windows - small interior rooms.  There was a private party in the main dining area so they put us in an elevator and put us in what I call the \""annex\"" upstairs with even less ambiance - looked like a converted hallway!  Avoid this scam at all cost!"
4,"I have promoted shows out of this venue, checked out some of my favorite local bands here, and spent my last birthday here. The owner has always been very hospitable and professional. The security staff is very professional and the bar tenders are always pouring amazing drinks. Needless to say I love this bar anyone who is a fan of live music at intimate venues should like the bar's facebook page for regular updates on upcoming shows."
3,Great sandwiches. And a ton of food.  Wasn't thrilled with their potato salad. Get fries instead.  Restaurant is kind of a kickback from old Vegas. Wait staff was friendly too.
4,"Well, it's ALMOST that time of year again. My favorite celebration... aside from Thanksgiving and Halloween. It's Matsuri. \n\nYeah, the parking rates around heritage square are pretty hefty when a big event like this rolls around. But it's totally worth it. I mean, when and where else in Arizona can you stuff yourself with steamed-right-in-front-of-you nikuman, take photos with samurai, see a kimono fashion show, feel really thankful you're out of high school and no longer as susceptible to the weirdness of cosplay, buy a hapi coat, pet a bunch of shiba-inu, marvel at bonsai trees that are older than your grandmother and watch almost 60 people wail on taiko drums? \n\nOK, I'm a little biased about the drums. But hey. We get quite a crowd, so other people must like it too. ;)"
2,"Even with a coupon, the drinks are overpriced ($13 girly drinks, $10 for Jack & Coke)...however, there's something to be said about killing an hour or two on a patio, drinking Jack & Cokes, watching the freaks parade down the strip."
0,"I am sooooo upset with PRS. Its not right what renters do with your deposit . We all know that they will find anything to keep your money, but this is ridiculous. And I will not shut up Im going to the news, every review website, write my congress man about this unfair practice. When I moved out the house was 99% perfect. All I missed was LIGHT BULBS. They charged me $70 dollars for 50cent light bulbs. They said everything was good on the phone and then I get the check which was 35% of my deposit.   We gave them slake when they took a year to fix the garage door and then they fix it when we move out. Why couldn't you give us a break?"
4,"We recently adopted our dog from my mom-in-law who lives in Casa Grande and I wanted to get Bruno in to see a vet in Tempe. I looked up a few offices and saw this location had an awesome rating. I was pleased to see someone I respect, Shayna K. from Scottsdale Doggie Suites, providing a 5 star rating and that was it. \n\nI immediately decided to make a new patient appointment for my furry baby. The office is clean, the staff is nice, and they made Bruno feel right at home. \n\nDr. Berthiaume came in and was very informative. I think he could tell I was a nervous \""new mom\"" and he helped me stay at ease. He suggested one medication for Bruno which is for heartworm prevention but didn't pressure me into making a purchase right then and there. He gave me a pamplet on it and told me to do some research on my own first. (AMEN!)\n\nWhen I told them about my concern about him scratching his ears a lot, they took swabs but didn't run them. Dr. B. said if he saw anything \""bad\"" he would have ran them for a test but didn't want to charge me for anything Bruno didn't need done. He suggested to have Bruno's stool tested but said we could bring in a sample anytime and they would send it off then. There was NO pressure to have tests done so they could get money out of me. \n\nThey genuinely cared about Bruno and my wallet. I will be going back, this is going to be my dog's doctor, and I appreciate how awesome everyone was. It is so refreshing to find a place that really care about the patients they see and the owners."
0,"Cheese sauce.  Not cheese, cheese sauce.  Burnt carne asada and pink Carne asada in the same burrito. They couldn't even make my daughter's quesadilla properly.  This place is to be avoided."
1,"I wanted to love this place with it's cute decor and giant coffee mugs. We went in on a weekday morning where there was enough staff on for every table to have their own server. After waiting 10 minutes to be greeted by a server that looked mildly annoyed she had an opportunity to make money while at her job... I ordered a coffee, my husband ordered a pineapple juice. The juice never came. We ordered breakfast.. Maybe the juice was being fresh squeezed? My husband ordered pancakes, I ordered the chilaquiles benedict. The pancakes came out like pancakes... The Benedict looked like everything my breakfast loving heart desired. The first bite was cold... I assessed it to be the mass amount of pico piled on top. A few more bites... Meh. Tried the other half without all the pico... ICE COLD meat. Appetite killed with the fear that Id be yacking up food poisoning later. After our server finally showed up.. Still no pineapple juice.... I informed her of the ice cold meat (Cold as if they took it out of the freezer, forgot to prep it and just piled it on top). She asked if I wanted another one. I declined saying I didn't have time to wait for another meal as my husband was already finished with his breakfast and it was a weekday. She said she would take it off the bill. I handed her my credit card to go ahead and run since everything seemed to take forever there. She brings it back... The manager took $5 off. The Benedict was $13.50. The manager also never even came to the table. I want to hate this place and never return, but I know there is so much potential on that menu. The sad part is the owner was sitting at the table next to usgoing over paperwork.... Oh well."
0,"Food was disappointing and ridiculously overpriced.  The whole restaurant reeked of charcoal/mesquite and not in a good way....we should have known the food was going to taste the same.  And it did. Awful.  I'm all for a burger grilled over hot coals, but when that is ALL you taste on a ridiculously overpriced burger with ala carte sides that you have to pay extra for and you leave smelling of burning mesquite, then that doesn't lend me to wanting to return.  And I won't.  The cheese on the burger was absolutely disgusting, a rubbery smoky nightmare.  Stay away from this place.  Not even service could save this place.  If Jasper's couldn't survive in this spot, this place doesn't even have a chance."
1,its ok.  visited on a tuesday night.  had the chicken fried rice... chicken dry.  egg rolls were good with the right amount of spice but the rest of the family's meal which was a bit of everything was all in all nothing different or unique than any Thai take out joints.  just ok.  service just ok.  price average.  lets just say not memorable.
1,"This place is pretty dumpy.\n\nWork sent me to Phoenix for a couple of days.  I had a suite, but it was not very sweet.  The bathroom door didn't shut, and swung open into the middle of the room.  When I got up to go to the bathroom at night, I ran into the door.  I can only blame Country Inn and Suite for the first night, the second night when I bumped into the bathroom door in the dark, I blamed only myself.\n\nThe bed smelled like my old roommate's closet... musty and dirty.  Two of my towels were stained with something yellow, I am hoping coffee and not urine...\n\nI didn't really expect better, but that's my review."
2,"My friend was in the mood for Mexican food so we decided to wander into El Segundo Sol.  We really like the ambiance of this place.  The food was surprisingly better than we expected.  She got a vegetarian taco plate and I got a pulled pork taco plate.  \n\nMy pulled pork was not what I was expecting, but I thought it was okay.  \n\nThe service here was lacking though.  Our waiter brought us chips and salsa even though we said we didn't want any when he asked.  And then he insisted that we had ordered it.  Of course he had to take it back, and we felt a little bad but we could noticeably tell that he was annoyed at us.  \n\nHe was overly attentive though.  He kept on filing my glass of water even though the pitcher of water was on the table.  And he kept on coming by to ask us, \""do you have everything you need right now?\"" often interrupting our conversation.  \n\nOn the whole I think if you're in the mood for slightly expensive Mexican food (about $15 a plate) then this place is worth checking out.  But I probably won't be back here until after I've checked out all the other places on the strip."
4,"Great wings, stiff pour and nice bartenders. XO Baer's Den 'till we meet again!"
3,The service is what makes this place a restaurant worth returning.  This Glendale location is better than the ones closer to my house.
3,"i don't doubt that many people have bad experiences at this restaurant, because I can see how a lot of the food is overpriced the hosting station seemed to be a little lackluster.  My experience went quite smoothly however.  I went with four people, after our slightly confused looking hostess found us a seat, we were provided with great service.  The service was intelligent, but in a very scripted manner.  The beer was good, great compared to american craft and decent compared to european breweries.  The building is a lot of fun, huge renovated church with shiny stainless steel fermenting silos covering the side wall and the altar.  I chose the special for the night, which was rib-eye finished in the wood burning oven and a cranberry chutney.  It was good, charred on the outside, not overdone and a good cut of meat to begin with.  The prices are high for what you get though, meaning I wasn't stuffed after my meal.  Main Pro: Good local beer\nMain Con: The smell of the bar, not the fermentation, was fairly strong."
2,"This is a fun place to stay when you don't want to spend a ton of money on a hotel room.  It is far enough from the strip so that you aren't stuck in that nasty traffic.\n\nThe front desk and valet service is always nice.  Their complimentary drinks (while playing) are always strong and their food isn't too bad.  The pool area is nice although they can use a little more shade options out there. \n\nThis place can feel a little run down from time-to-time in their regular rooms and they definitely need some upgrades.  Outside of that, it is not too bad of a place to visit every now and then."
4,"I'm on a four to five star review binge, but they're all deserving, and Bunky's is no exception.\n\nCame here on a Saturday at around 3 for an early dinner and the place was dead. The hostess was sweet as pie and informed us that they were switching over to their dinner menu. It's quite large, with a mix between Italian and Mediterranean fare, but was not overwhelming in the slightest.\n\nTo start, we ordered a hummus appetizer, and it was so incredibly good - served with warm pieces of soft, airy and delicious pieces of pita. Ugh, I'm eating some store brand hummus and crackers as I type this, and they've got nothin' on Bunky's.\n\nI set my eyes on one of Bunky's staples: Bunky's Pasta. It's loaded with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, onions and farfalle noodles. It's mixed with the most mouthwatering creamy marinara sauce. The sauce was sweet and the plate savory, and all worked well together to create a cohesive dish.\n\nI know that Bunky's has some funky hours, but please make time to stop in when they're open. You will be glad you did."
3,"I love donuts no matter how you spell them and O Face Doughnuts delivers.  Their staff is super friendly and the donuts are great.  I got the Maple Bacon w/ Maple Mascarpone one and it literally was one that needed a fork and knife. So great and if you're a donut lover, check this place out!"
0,"My wife and I left this evening (Cinco de Mayo) without being served or approached 15 minutes after seating ourselves in the bar. When we got up to leave the manager/bar tender asked where we were going, and when I told her wasn't any staff to wait on us on this usually bust night in Mexican restauarants she said ahe didn't have time for any complaints...totally non-professional.\nNeedless to say, we won't return in the future."
2,The line to check in is really long! Also we booked a king bed but got one queen bed! There was no hot water in the shower either. The location of this hotel is great though because it's in the middle of the strip so I liked that.
2,"For our weekly pizza delivery, we decided to try something new and got Manolo's.\n\nWe opted for the largest size thin crust with half pepperoni and half sausage. We also got 3 empanadas for $6 to go with it, delivery time was about an hour, which is to be expected on a weekend. This amount of food was just enough for our group of 3 in terms of portions.\n\nThe pizza was decent, definitely better than a Papa John's or similar chain. I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better. My issue with this pizza, and perhaps all thin crust/New York style is the lack of sauce. The sauce is so key to the flavor that often times without it your just eating a cheesy breadstick. I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce. The pepperoni wasn't that good, however, the sausage was unusually good, it tasted fresh and wasn't just a mushy piece of nothing, great flavor! I think I will get sausage if I order again. The crust was good, crispy bottom but edible edges.\n\nFeedback on the empanadas was a unanimous OK. I can only personally speak for the cheesecake empanada. The filling didn't resemble something you could get at The Cheesecake Factory, but it also wasn't just dried goop. Not too bad! I think the empanadas might be a really good bargain if you got a lot of them and the price was around $1 each.\n\nI have not tried any of the specialty pizzas and I may have to do that and then update my review. I will also have to try The Empanadas House for a fair comparison.\n\nOverall we thought Manolo's was just OK, we thought it might have been just a little pricey, but we were not disappointed with our food.\n\nI'll be back!"
0,Waited 20 min before the girl told Us its a 30 min wait..... Didn't know that it take 30 min to make one smoothie.... Would not recommend any one to go before she didn't even seem like she wanted to take our order
1,"In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet. \nI had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \""For this?\"" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe. Stay away if you're used to eating at the Chinese buffet."
2,"Somehow Asian food just works at night...Noodles is inside the maze of the Bellagio and it's pretty large. Service is ok, but it's sorta expensive. Like $18 for HK style noodles. Given how complex it is to get in and out of hotels, and if you are craving asian food late at night, I'd go to Noodles...."
2,"I gave this an A-OK rating because i'm not an expert of PHO. I like the food, but just haven't been to plenty of vietnamese places.\n\nI ordered the spicy beef pho. It was good, very large bowl and the price was great ! This place was recommended to me by my asian friends. And i saw lots of asain peeps eating there as well, so it's probably a good place. Service was good, even though they were really busy.  I would go again, the menu has plenty of selections."
2,"The skybar itself did not wow me, but I guess it's cool that it's different than the usual bars/clubs in Southside.  The place was small and can get kinda steamy if crowded.  Maybe it's better during the warmer season.  It was colder when my friends and I went, so it was covered.\n\nThe pre-made frozen drinks at skybar weren't that great according to my friends.  One had the pina colada, which she said didn't taste anything like pina colada.  Tasted like frozen nasty alcohol.  My other friend had the strawberry daiquiri, which she ended up returning to the bar after 2 sips.  The bartender was nice enough to change it to a better tasting drink that's on the rocks instead of being frozen.  I don't really know whether to recommend this place to a friend, I guess I will if it's their first time.  Otherwise, I probably won't go up to skybar.  Also, they charge an $8 cover.\n\nAnyway, we couldn't hear the music, so we decided to go down to Diesel after about 10-15 mins at skybar.  Diesel had more people and definitely more fun than skybar."
0,"The store is dirty, but much worse, the folks at the registers seem to be trained to be rude, and have the social skills of a grocery bag.  I live less than a mile away and was excited to find a Sprouts in my new neighborhood.  After the first few times there, I stopped going and drive well past this store to others.  Recently, I needed some organic tomatoes quickly and so, I thought I would give this Sprouts another try. The girl behind the register never spoke to me and seemed as if it was a real inconvenience to ring up four tomatoes. She practically threw my change and receipt at me.  Never again.  Five or six times of poor service is enough."
1,Place way over priced
4,The piano bar is awesome!!! All I have to say is these guys r hilarious! Upbeat and straight up entertaining!! This is very delayed. I was here 2/13/11. Wrote it while I was still at the bar and just haven't been on here in a while to post it.
1,"This restaurant does indeed have a problem with general cleanliness.  However, the food was really good and so I'd probably still go back.  My friend and I spent about $10 each for one of the family dinners...and let me tell you, it was an enormous amount of food!  It even included a whole lobster, which was really tasty.  You will see most of the seafood chillin in the tanks when you first walk in, so you know it's at least freshly killed.\n\nHowever, like the other reviewers I can't give this more than 2 stars since the place is so filthy.  In all seriousness, the service was friendly but I had to keep kicking a cockroach away with my foot during dinner.\n\nHonestly, these guys could dominate the local market for traditional chinese dining if they'd just clean up a little and spend more than five dollars on the interior decor.  All the handwritten signs all over the walls advertising prices on fresh \""geo ducks\"" and shrimp, along with the harsh fluorescent lighting, are just over-the-top carelessness."
1,We finally came here for dinner but we were disappointed. There wasn't alot to choose from and it's quite expensive. The service was fine and the food was pretty decent but we expected a very different menu and a larger one at that. Plus their prices were way too much. I doubt we'd be back.
2,"The chicken shwarma, kaftta and hommus deluxe are excellent. The garlic sauce is so good I want to drink it. Can you smell my breath from here?\nAwesome staff and a cool store in the back. Try the cookies and the baklava, they're delicious."
0,"Twice we ordered take out as Rosati's isn't far from our house and we had guests. Both times they lost our order, the 1st time we weren't told this until after we paid!!  The second time we called and mentioned the problem to avoid a repeat missed order, and they did it again! lol!  \nAnd both times it took well over 30 minutes to get our order and on second time the order wasn't complete and that took 10 more minutes to fix!\nWhat's the saying......'fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me?'  We haven't been back since!   And btw, the food wasn't anything special!"
2,"Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated chilled dessert market. The iced cream is made right in front of you with subtle variations on your classic flavors. This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\n\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\n\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\n\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK."
1,"I was born really close to the Mexican border so when I heard this was the best Mexican place in town, naturally I had to act fast.\n\nIt's located centrally which is pretty nice - not in the best neighborhood, but easy access to the freeway.\n\nI should've known that this place was going to be a disaster from they're chips and salsa. One salsa was way too spicy and the other tasted like tomato sauce. \n\nWhen our food arrived (after a good wait) my guacamole had a fowl, spoiled taste and my mom's steak was rare. We sent both plates back (which I never do) and my second plate came equipped with beef instead of the chicken I order. Besides that, the food was just mediocre. The beans were too salty, and the meat was under-seasoned. \n\nPrices are reasonable for a sit down joint, but you can honestly get better food a Roberto's. Skip this one!"
1,"Brown rice is MUSH!  Today was the second time I've been since my office moved a block away.  I gave it another chance because there is no way a place like this would over cook their rice to the point where it practically melted together....think again.  I have been to Samurai Sams a million times over the years for the \""healthy alternative\"" to fast food and either something has changed to the quality of food or I've been there too many times that I'm burned out.  The rice issue is huge...who wants mushy rice?  Like someone said in reviews below-everything is now premade just sitting there.  Not sure how true that is but thats what it seems.  Big bummer. :("
2,If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant.
4,Great customer service and well priced rentals. Good advice on trails to take and local sites to see. My buddy got a puncture (complete with sunstroke) and a member of the team came out to meet us and replace the tire.
1,"The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \n\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \n\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \n\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \n\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \n\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\n\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \""eh\"" \n\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \n\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\n\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \n\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \""THE BEST\"" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \n\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \n\nFor the owner? You have your work cut out for you, I am not a professional in the food service industry but you should consider \""Restaurant Stakeout\"" if you find your patronage decline."
3,"The first impression was a good one.  The host led us to our table and I couldn't help but notice the murals of Aztec leaders and ancient designs painted on the walls.  The dining area has a warm and inviting feel.  Festive music can be heard but not too loud.  After being greeted by a waiter in traditional garb they immediately brought us their house chips which are light and crispy and they'll bring as many as you can eat.  \n\nThe salsa is watery, chunky, lacks any kick and I didn't find the pico de gallo appetizing either.  But the guacamole is made fresh table-side by a charming woman who doesn't speak much but smiles a lot.  You get to choose how spicy and whether you want onions, cilantro, lime, or all of the above.  She then muddles it in a stone serving dish and lets you taste-test it before she sets it on your table and moves on.\n\nThe ground beef tacos are too greasy.  But the flank steak in the Tacos al Carbon is sublime compared to the other items I've tried so far.  The menu is huge so there are still plenty of items to try on return visits.  For the value and down home atmosphere it's a great alternative to the other high (snooty) and low (scary) Mexican restaurants around town."
2,"The husband and I wanted to hit up a few good buffets during our stay. We received mixed reviews for the Wynn buffet, but found it easy to eat at since we were going to watch le reve. After standing in line for about 20 mins (on a Tuesday around 7pm) we were seated. The entry way is gorg but lead back the buffet area the decor seemed a bit outdated, but still very nice.\n\nThe food experience - I just didn't find anything special. The food is all good, but nothing was drool worthy.  They have salads, american, Italian, grilled foods, ramen station, asian and seafood. It was a great variety, but like I said nothing stood out. My favorite was the dessert bar. It had a good variety."
4,"Massage, massage!! I am visiting from out of town and wanted a massage. They were great on getting my sceduled in on last minute. I had a neck and shoulder massage from Lawerence and i highly recommend him! I typically dont like massages because I just don't have luck with finding someone good. He was great and will come back when I visit again!"
3,"This review is not about the food but the slamming ultra lounge that is The Cathouse.\n\nIf you like house music in a less crowded atmosphere where you can actually socialize with people, this is the lounge for you.\n\nDrinks are very fairly priced.  Hostesses are very professional delivering incredible service (yeah they are also hot but this is not one of those clubs).\n\nMake some local friends and get in without cover.\n\nCheck the Luxor website before you head out to the lounge.  There are different themes during the week including a hip-hop and an \""alternative lifestyle\"" night."
3,"After 24 hours on the Strip, you need to get away. A 15-minute drive out to an anonymous, deserted strip mall on W. Sahara you'll find Rosemary's, whose food can compete bite-for-bite w/ the Michelin 1- and 2-star restaurants at the resorts. We deferred to the prix fixe menus and were not disappointed!"
3,"I saw Keith Urban and LIttle Big Town recently, this was my first concert since moving to Phoenix. I've seen Keith up close before and to save money we chose lawn seats, the sound was great, he played in the center for several songs giving us a close up performance, his lighting and video behind the stage was super. i agree the concessions/beer prices are ridiculous but I wasn't surprised. It was a perfect night weather wise, it did run late and we left a few minutes earlier than he stopped performing.\nI do recommend exiting the I 10 before 83rd, that's where all the traffic was. I will arrive earlier to get a better lawn seat but we had a great time, in fact will be there for Jason Aldean the 17th! For $30 sitting in my own chair in the lawn under the stars is worth it."
1,"I used to love this place. So much so, that I gave them several chances to remind me of that long lost love affair. Last 3 out of 3 times has been terrible. My hot and sour soup came to me about the color of mustard. And it was sickeningly sweet. My fried wontons were virtually meatless, and my combo fried rice didn't have any discerning flavor at all. $20 later and all i can say is that I'm so disappointed.  I will never order from them again. I will stick with Red House for my wonton fix and continue to search for a go to place for fried rice."
0,Used to like this place now it's sucking more and more each time I go this was my last visit when I ordered country crepes and I got hash and eggs even the coke was flat
3,"One of my favorite taco places. It's super far from me but every time I'm on this side of town I always have to stop by here for a few freshly made tacos.\n\nIt's about $2+ per taco. All served with corn tortilla which I personally don't like since I prefer flour tortilla and to get flour tortilla it's an extra $.50 per taco (which sucks bc you would think that it's included, all those $.50s add up haha) \n\nWeds is buy 1 ($2) get the 2nd taco free on the pork taco ..in other words a $1 each"
3,"It was pretty good. We had the calamari which was excellent. I had the fettuccine with shrimp, it was good."
2,"Atmosphere, Atmosphere, Atmosphere \n\nI make a pilgrimage to this place about every three months. The food is average and overpriced. The service is OK. And there is usually one good Pale Ale on tap and overpriced. \n\nIt is kinda like going to Disneyland. You know you are going to take in the shorts but you go anyway. You go to live the dream if only for an hour or two. \n\nIf you ever went fishing as a kid or wished you had,  grab your wallet or purse and eat here asap."
1,Horrible happy hour martinis - unless you like pure sugar syrup. Food is not much better. Would not recommend it.
0,I made appointment prior to coming here but still waited for an hour. The place is nice but looks can be deceiving because of the bad service they provided me. Please don't waste your time coming here totally not worth the wait!!!
0,"I just had a late lunch. The all you can eat sushi was not worth it. The food was not fresh. It was horrible!!! I've been here quite a few times but I don't remember the food tasting like this. First of all, the edamame was not eatable. I couldn't even get the peas out of the pods. The chicken skewers were dried and had a weird smell with it. Perhaps the meat was sitting out too long?? The sushi items we ate didn't taste fresh. Especially the tuna. We also ordered the green mussels which was burnt and ruin the rest of my appetite. Overall for lunch I should of starve."
0,Totally avoid this place. Spend a few more $$s and go to the one at Bellagio but do so after 12noon as the Japenese and Italian stations do not open until then. The food at Flavor lacked flavor completely. It must take some effort to make simple dishes taste so bad!
3,"Breakfast to die for!!!\n\nMy wife and I got in late, and woke up the next day hungry. We wanted breakfast so I yelp for local places.  We have tried Hash House a Go Go, great place when not watching your calories.  I saw other places with comments $40 for breakfast ya da, ya da.  We were staying in the Venezia tower and had eaten at Bouchon's before. \n\n I noticed that Bouchon served breakfast so I was game.  I was not disappointed.  French pastry's, European coffee, what could be better.\n\nI ordered the omelet of the day, stuffed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and cheese.  Perfect eggs, good sausage, with brioche toast.\n\nMy wife had the bread pudding French toast with warm Carmel vanilla sauce. \""Heaven on a plate\"" according to my wife.  \n\nThe service was great, and for the strip, and an upscale restaurant the $38 dollar breakfast was another great moment.\n\nIf you stay anywhere near this place it is a must try for breakfast."
2,"They weren't busy so the server was on the money! I tried the pulled pork fajitas and my girlfriend try the chicken fajitas. The veggies and tortillas were awesome but everything else kind of lacked flavor. The server brought out plenty of chips with three different kinds of salsa. They were unique but none really popped for me. We ordered some fried ice cream, a necessity at a Mexican restaurant, and after about 15 minutes the waitress informed us that they didn't have it. The manager offered to buy us desserts for the inconvenience, which was pretty awesome if u ask me. I had the key lime pie and the kids had the kids Sunday. I will have to try this place again and see if something else on the menu has some Zing."
0,"Disorganized. Ripoffs. Rude, airhead employees that don't clean and freely talk on there cell phones whilst you asking them a simple question. Id rather rub sand in my eyes. Disgusted."
3,"Came here on a Tues night at 6pm. Warning. If your coming after 6pm, make a reservation! We were a party of 5 and were lucky to get in. They did accommodate us, but told us we had to leave by 7.  This place got so crowded at 6pm!! Full house! Legit Japanese place. My folks had the ramen, and I had a chicken egg bowl plus a few skewers on the side. Traditional Japanese recipes coming from someone who is Japanese.My folks came with me. They ordered the ramen, but preferred Monta Ramen better.( see my review on them) \nService was a bit hectic, but the place was packed so I don't blame them. Foo"
4,"I should have reviewed this place long ago but I was too busy eating there to take the time to sit down and write. \n\nWe have been going here since they opened, first enticed in by a Groupon and then brought back by Chef Steve's wonderfully inspired dishes. This is a small plates restaurant so do not order one plate and expect to be full. The menu is divided into individual proteins and veggies. Read the descriptions carefully and then order enough to share. My husband and I typically order four or five plates and then hesitate over dessert. Chef Steve did a menu change recently so now we will be enjoying some new items and hope that you also try them out. Go with a group of people, its more fun\n\nThe Poke is one of my favorites, but make sure you mix it to get the seasoning all through it. One the new new additions is the Beef Carpaccio, Very flavorful. Also the shrimp dish, I believe its called Mini Mi's but its on a bun with slaw. The slaw is so good I would eat just that. They are so many dishes that it is truly had to remember. Checkout their ode to the Monte Cristo, it will make you weep. The owners work hard to provide good service and are always looking to improve. So.....if you want to eat and not be bothered go for lunch during the day. If you want busy with some music and noise check them out on a Friday night. They have a Facebook page that will tell you if there is something going on before you head out. Since I am all about the food, we go during the daytime. They also apparently have a happy hour but I don't know what that is about, I have just read the sign.\n\nThe decor is very basic, as is the plating and utensils. Because we have been coming here since the beginning, we have been able to see the changes they have made to the place over time. I can see where they have spent their money and am able to understand their choices. I would much rather have great food than great decor."
4,"I've been to The Vig a handful of times... for at least 4 lunches, a few times for just drinks / happy hour, and at least 2 dinners.  I think that is a fair amount of visits to justify the 4.5 star review rounded up to 5 stars that I am giving it now!\n\nI've always had friendly and attentive service, and I've never had a problem with the food or drinks I've ordered.  Granted, I've probably just ordered beer, iced tea, or water, but still :)\n\nI'm adding The Vig to my list of places to go for great sweet potato fries.  They also offer really yummy starters including the Vings (grilled wings), Grilled Veggie Platter, Hummus, and Ceviche.  At lunchtime, I recommend the Cobb salad although several friends of mine consistently order the Vig Azz Burger.  For dinner, I love their \""Miso Hungry Salmon.\""  \n\nAs mentioned in other reviews, their outdoor dining area and bocce court are just what Phoenix needs more of on a beautiful day or evening!  So much fun!\n\nIf this beautiful weather continues, I'll be hanging out at The Vig again very soon!"
0,"Seemingly popular with the 20-somethings with long lines in the evening, we stopped in BurGR for a late lunch and it seems GR is living on his celebrity, not his cooking or service.  It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.  Don't use the excuse \""it's Vegas, Baby.\""   Ramsay is there to take your money.  I think I'm older and more experienced at decent dining than many of the reviewers for this place.  Note the reviews that say they are fans of Ramsay - doesn't have a thing to do with the food actually served - and I assure you - Ramsay didn't cook these things."
1,"While everything is fresh, I am still not impressed.  I prefer the true Mediterranean restaurants, like Spices.  This place is just another trendy spin on Mediterranean food.  Examples:  the tzatziki had chunks of cucumber (weird) and the Greek salad didn't have olives.  Won't be back."
3,"I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  \n\nThe ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. \n\nThe place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.\n\nI went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning."
1,"Very Trendy hotel!!!  \n\nA friend was able to get me a free room for my birthday!   Thanks KJ!  :-)\n\nThe check in process was LONG-even in VIP, however I guess I shouldn't complain because it was free...\n\nThe room was cute and clean.   I enjoyed the views from the wraparound terrace.\n\nRoom service was GREAT!!!  \n\nI asked the bartender at the vesper bar  to  Surprise me with a drink that was fruity yet would still give me a buzz, she hooked me up with a SAGE 75!!!   Let's just say I enjoyed it to the fullest!!!  \n\nShopping in the hotel  left something to be desired.   \n\nI don't think I'll stay here again, however it was nice to experience it -  especially since it was free!  ;-)"
0,"I am a big fun of French food and patisserie, I used to go to that  place 3 times a week for breakfast or lunch, but everything change there during this last year, I order Marquez, and they serve it to me almost burned, u cannot taste any thing.  \nLast Sunday I was there they close at 4pm, I was there  at 3pm, and I want to order omelet, the server there she told me the kitchen is close, we can't cook anything, come on!!\nI had many bad experiences there, I will never go back, there are many other French bakery in vegas"
3,"Cheap, cheap eats! Really great breakfast and service. The bloody mary was delish and for only $5, it packed a wallop for the small glass."
1,"Republic Ramen looks and sounds like a promising restaurant; unfortunately, my first bite told me otherwise.  While the food is not inedible, it definitely does NOT resemble traditional Japanese ramen.  I ordered an original milk tea boba & a bowl of tonkotsu ramen with pork.  The pork is nothing like the pork that comes with authentic ramen.  Instead, it was pale, tough, and flavorless.  The noodles and soup are fine but way less flavorful than I am used to from a restaurant advertising themselves as a ramen restaurant and not just a plain noodle house.  And the boba I ordered was VERY flavorless and watered down.  However, on the bright side, the boba pearls were the perfect texture and level of chewiness!"
4,"No special request is too special for John.  Even a soy allergy can be handled in this awesome sushi restaurant.  Don't eat shell fish, but still want sushi?  No problem.  John's is the best hands down."
1,"Difficult to find.  Annoying bar setup with mostly garbage Bud/Miller/Coors products like Blue Moon, and they had the nerve to serve me a Guinness in a frosty glass.  Service was a bit slow.  Prices were reasonable though.  Old building on the outside but decent inside."
3,"I guess we arrived right after their rush hour because there were no tables readily available when we arrived but about 60% full which can be understandable. But we were seated within 5 minutes, but the menus took another 5 minutes to come.\nI ordered the 4 course of salad, tandoori chicken, mixed vegetables, banana bread pudding, and a chai latte included in the end. Chicken was very tender and the salad a large order with even more salad placed on the same plate of the entree. Bread pudding very very good to finish. The gf had chicken marsala which was very sweet on its own but went very well with the garlic naan we ordered on the side. Main entrees were a bit on the smaller side.\nThe server was joking around a little, calling my chicken KFC when it came and saying the bread pudding came with ketchup and mustard. Funny guy."
2,"On our recent one day trip to las vegas we decided to have dinner at this place since we were residing far from the strip blvrd. The menu was very interesting and very confusing, So I let the other order. My favorite was pieces of salmon, and the one with the quail egg.\nIn general the service was really good, super friendly and very fast. Fish was very fresh."
3,"Horrible food (except the garlic bread, that was actually pretty good!).  It's annoying that they only take cash, I feel like this is 1995 again.   It's also annoying you have to go to two sections to order your drinks, you can't order them with your meal.\n\nHOWEVER, it's cheap entertainment.   Have a little kid? Spend $25, take the family here, they will enjoy it."
2,"My husband and I finally checked out this place after hearing about it only a couple weeks ago.  The idea of a cute storefront restaurant on Main Street intrigued us.  We went on a weeknight and found the place surprisingly full - there were only five (of about 15-20) tables available when we arrived.  However, we were quickly seated and provided with our requested drinks.\n\nWe had pork bellies and kale chips for our appetizers.  The pork bellies were divine.  The kale chips were a bit lacking in flair.  It was basically dry kale with paprika sprinkled on top.  Not much else.\n\nMy husband got the Local Dish burger and declared it good.  The fries he got on the side were great.  I ordered their chicken & peaches sandwich with coleslaw on the side.  The coleslaw was fantastic and I could have eaten more than the serving they gave me.  The chicken sandwich was average - but I loved knowing I was probably eating peaches from just a few blocks away at the Peach Stand.  The chicken itself was a bit dry but was helped by the pesto, spinach and peaches that came on it.\n\nWhy did I not give it more than 3 stars?  Because a second visit will be required, with other foods tried, before I decide to bump it up to four stars.  The restaurant was charming enough (and prices decent enough) that we'll most likely go back again the future."
4,"My favorite thing about Stalzy's is that they stick to the basics but they do them really well. The menu may not sound super impressive in comparison to the prices but when you get your meal the quality is superb. These sandwiches are made with quality, local ingredients and with the above average drink selection they really provide the deli experience I expect. Dont let the simple titles fool you this top notch food is worth of your lunch(or breakfast) hour any day.\n\nMy sandwich of choice is the ham and swiss, simple, delectable, delicious :)"
3,"My wife and I had dinner there last night. It was superb. \nDon!t know what people are talking about regarding  nachos and sangria.\nThis is totally good French food. The ambiance, the decor, the food presentation were all in keeping with what a high level restaurant should be. The restaurant was not very busy as it was relatively early evening\nSo the waiter did not rush the servings along enabling us to dine at\nOur own pace. Our prize fixe meal was $47each plus wine, tax, and tip\nThe three course meal consisted of a lovely green salad, the entree was salmon for me that was cooked perfectly served with what appeared to be roasted barley mix and green beans. My wife has a veal chop that she liked but what I thought was a little too rare on the inside although\nWell charred on the outside. Desert was a glorious crime de br\u00fbl\u00e9e that was to die for. \nIn summary we both thought it was a good dining experience and a good value for the price.\nWe would go back again and recommend to friends."
3,Went here on a Friday night around nine and was sat right away. I chose the Chilean sea bass and my dinner companions chose the bone in ribeye and the new your strip. After sampling everything I would have to say the ribeye was the best. We also tried their oyster Rockefeller and it was delicious!
1,They are a nice alternative to Zimbrick in Madison is you have a foreign car.  However I would recommend Zimbrick as the mechanics at Zimbrick will tell you what items you can do yourself to save money.  Look out at Dunn's as they may try to add on additional services that you don't really need which will cost you more money.
4,"Up there with Crave for a classy bar with good, expensive martinis.  Nice, modern lighting, the atmosphere makes me feel fabulous.....who am I kidding, I am fabulous!  There's always a cute boy around to by me a drink, so the prices don't bother me too much.  Their \""one & done\"" drinks knock my socks off.....heed the warning that the name gives....I'm serious.....brings me back to my jungle juice days at house parties.  5 stars!"
0,"Negative baristas heaven forgive they mess up your order and u ask them to remake it. No asking if it was right the second time, still not right but they are so rude ur afraid to ask for them to actually try it again. Also soooo sloooooooowww come on people drink some coffee and get motivated... lets work on niceness and speed."
2,"This place was okay, I wasn't too impressed. The neighborhood is great, but I didn't feel like the coffee shop was anything special. There isn't a lot of table space, so it's hard to do work.\n\nThe drinks were good, though. Seemed to be mostly fair priced. \n\nLike I said, it was good, but nothing special. I may or may not come back."
4,Awesome! We're from la and this was a treat! Chicken del sol was awesome!  Go here there's something healthy and delecious for everyone!
1,First time at Extreme Pita.  It is a little different than Pita Pit. I had the small smoked turkey and my husband had the buffalo chick.  Was not impressed with the food nor the staff. Not sure we will go back.
4,"I love both locations equally. Such a delicious cafe caramel. I also really love their tea selections. The baristas are always friendly, and there's always a place to sit. What more can you ask for? :)"
3,"Went here with my roommate last week for a late breakfast and was pleasantly surprised! I got the Eggs Benedict and a chocolate croissant while my roommate went for the French toast with fresh fruit. Everything was very tasty, although my roommate could have easily handled a larger portion. \nAll the employees were super sweet and the French owner's eclectic playlist really added to how much I enjoyed the experience. Will have to go again for lunch or dinner!"
3,"I recently brough my car up to Edinburgh from home, where it had sat on the drive pretty much since I had left home to go to university.\n\nAs I'm sure you can imagine, it was pretty filthy, so I pulled up here expecting to shell out \u00a35 or so for a crappy was that wouldnt really be that great.\n\nNeedless to say, when I realised that the cheapest was was \u00a32, i was suprised and I was even more suprised when the car came out looking like a million dollars.\n\nVery impressive for \u00a32, but thier prices can go up to around \u00a36 - which I'm sure must involve so many polishes and waxes and cleans that dirt must be simply repelled from the body of your car, never getting dirty again."
3,"Always enjoy our visits to RA. Our party of six arrived early afternoon. The restaurant was fairly slow,  we were seated quickly and greeted very friendly by Tiffany. \n\nWe ordered edamame, steamed and RA chips and salsa (tuna tartar with salsa and avocado served with wonton chips). \n\nWe were unsure of what to drink and Tiffany recommended White Sake Sangria. What a great recommendation!\n\nOur group shared udon noodles, Las Vegas roll, crispy tuna roll and two California rolls for the kids. \n\nWe really enjoy the atmosphere and grooving music to dance to with the kids!  Each meal is really fun because we mix it up and don't go in with any preconceived notions and our kids love it."
0,"I WILL NEVER USE VEGAS.COM OR STAY AT CAESARS\nWe were booked to stay here 7/3 for 2 nights & left after the 1st. The bathroom fixtures were rusted, the bottom of the door was broken & coming apart, urine had ate away at the marble around the toilet the grout around the tub was dirty & moldy. The other doors were 1.5 inches from reaching the floor, we could see out into the hall & into the adjoining room. the air conditioner was very clanking. They sent someone to fix it which was no help. They switched our room to an nicer room that had 1/2 the crystals stolen off the wall sconce chandelier. The blanket had a big hole in it & the lighting was too dim to apply my make-up. We asked where the buffet was & they said it had been closed for month & vegas.com should have told us & they didn't. They suggested we go to Flamingo's buffet which was closed for 4 hours due to a water problem. We then walked to Paris who's buffet was open but were out of food. No meat, no fresh cooked veggies. The salad bar was old wilted lettuce with no tomatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes or other fresh veggies. At least the Phantom of the Opera at the Venetian was outstanding. I will never stay at Caesars and never book from Vegas.com & will tell everyone i know to avoid both of these when booking a Vegas get away"
2,"I would have paid ten dollars more per entree if it would have been a little bit better. The duck was excellent but my husband's lamb was kind of disappointing.  The server got a little snooty when we ordered water instead of drinks.  Don't get me wrong-- the duck reallywas tastey, but it looked like the best meal there."
4,"This event was broken into two parts. The first was a walking tour of Bloomfield courtesy of Burgh Bits & Bites and the second was a beer tasting at Church Brew Works courtesy of Jake of PA Brew Tours.\n\nRichard and Sylvia from Burgh, Bits and Bites Tours were absolutely great! I never knew Bloomfield was so interesting and had so much history and I've lived in the Pittsburgh area my whole life. LOL! The walking tour consisted of the following stops, Angelo's Pizzeria, Groceria Italia, Merante's Gifts and Donateli's. While on the tour we learned about the different architecture of the area including dental crown molding and the beautiful St. Joseph's Church.\n\nThe first stop, Angelo's Pizzeria served us some delicious cheese pizza. (I will be back soon!) \n\nThe second stop, Groceria Italia a cute little Italian grocery store that has been in the neighborhood for decades was my favorite stop. The fact that they make all of their pasta, sausages and meats by hand is a plus during a time when most things are made by machines. While there we got to meet \""Momma\"" and sample some homemade meatballs and pasta, outstanding!\n \nThe third stop, Merante's Gifts is a cozy little store that sells Italian among other home decor items. It's the perfect store to find trinkets for your Nana. Maria, the owner who also does cooking classes in the apartment upstairs served us some tasty iced coffee in the kitchen where she does her classes. We also each got a amazing dessert while back in the gift shop.\n\nThe fourth and final stop of the walking tour was Donateli's, a Italian grocery store similar to Groceria Italia. The main difference between the two is that Donateli's pasta is not homemade and is supplied from another company. While there we got to try a orange and chocolate biscotti and see the \""back of house\"" machines.\n\nThe Brewery portion was nice also. We got to sample three different beers. I don't drink beer so I can't really say they were all that good. Jake really knows the history of beer in Pittsburgh. The only bad thing that happened was the shuttle bus that dropped us off at Church Brew Works left us stranded and we had to wait for him to come back. Not Jake's fault.\n\nThanks Rachel for another great event."
0,"Sometimes there really needs to be a \""no star\"" option. Or maybe a \""it was so bad they owe me some damn stars\"" choice. But there isn't so I'll go with a one-star review and I'll add a caveat of \""how shitty do you want to be treated?\""\n\nIt's time for Jim to get a new company car. We're excited about this because we tire of driving around in a gas-hog. And Jim is particularly optimistic about a new car because they put a jeep on the list. Now granted, it's not the rubicon of his dreams but it is a \""better mileage\"" jeep and that's a start.\n\nSo we went over to Superstition Springs Jeep because they had a number of the specific model on the lot. He wanted to test drive all the choices and decide which car to order.\n\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by four salesmen. Jim told them why we were there. As soon as they realized his was to be a fleet purchase they blew us off. They pointed at a group of cars and went under a tree to smoke. We did take a look, not really believing that they actually blew us off like that, but of course all but a couple base models were locked up tight.\n\nWe went inside, still hoping to pull this time-waster out of the craper, and Jim went over to the sales manager. He explained what we wanted and what we'd experienced so far. He made clear that being blown off was unacceptable. The manager mumbled something mildly apologetic and walked off. Jim went in search of a fleet person. \n\nWhen the manager came back he asked me for the name of my husband's company. I told him and he responded that fleet orders go directly to the factory. The implication was that we couldn't expect anyone to help us because there was nothing in it for them.\n\nI told the manager that I considered it a mistake because you never know who you're dealing with. I told him that I might be in the market for a new car in six or eight months (which is true if certain events come to pass) and that I certainly wouldn't buy it anyplace that I was treated so rudely.\n\nThe manager looked at me and told me that if that's the way I felt I should go find another dealership to test drive a jeep.\n\nLet me repeat that, just in case you missed it. We were treated rudely and when we objected we were told to leave. \n\nI think the manager was hoping to intimidate me. At least it seemed that way from the way he towered over me, hands on hips, scowling. But I looked at him, smiled and told him he was absolutely right. I called to Jim, told him what the manager said, and we left.\n\nI have to say I am impressed by a company whose commission-only business philosophy involves alienating your customer. Especially since Jim's good sized fleet has to be serviced somewhere and the service department generates a huge amount of the dealership income.\n\nSuffice it to say we were treated much better elsewhere. We won't be back."
4,"If they had Electric Six's \""Gay Bar\"" I would be tempted to play it every time I came. All wise cracks aside and the frequent mentions that this is a gay bar. The Garage is a place that transcends the need to be labeled and is just fun for everyone. No matter if you are GLBT or straight. When the urge to go hang out at a cool bar with cheap drinks, clean facilities, an abundance of games, friendly bartenders, and sports playing on all the TV, this will always be the first choice. You would think it would be difficult to get a bunch of straight guys into this place, but there is never a need to convince them, because it is not a place where people go trolling. \n\nMonday nights are board shorts night offering $1 well drinks and domestic drafts from 9 to midnight. I guess having the cheapest happy hour in town is not enough."
4,"Las Fuentes has the best Mexican food in Surprise! Very nice staff as well. We eat here at least once a month and we are never disappointed. Portions are huge! The prices are so reasonable and the food is delicious! My favorites are their shrimp Caesar salad, shrimp al mojo de ajo, any burrito and we always enjoy their buffet as well."
2,"Pros: \n-open 24hrs\n-organized waiting list\n-clean for a pho place\n-quick, but crap service(typical of viet places)\n-the pho helped my hangover\n\n\nCons:\n-crap service\n-meh pho\n-8 bucks for pho\n-smaller portions than other pho joints I've been to\n\nOverall, it's a pretty mediocre place. If you're in Vegas and have a pho craving, it will do. But just don't expect it to do that much."
1,Standing room on the side balconies was waaaaaay over packed. We paid big bucks to see Muse and could barely see them at times. They really over sold this show.
4,"Deeelicious!  The first time my wife and I went here, we were amazed at how NOT busy it was.  Every restaurant in the Phoenix area seems to be constantly busy - every day - but not this one!  Each time we have been here, we have either been the only people in the place or one of only 2 occupied tables!  Weird!  We asked our server about this and were told they do a lot of take-out business.  We have noticed this to be true on our visits.  Ok - on to the food.  We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!  I would agree that the salads are good - I generally get the side house salad with ranch dressing.  It is always fresh and crisp with lots of veggies.  All-in-all we will definitely continue to eat at this restaurant!"
3,"Big chains are important to submit reviews for.\nEven though the biz would have you believe that it  means you'll get consistent product and service across their multitudinous locations, has this ever been the case?  Even Taco DingDong taco meat is spicier in Phoenix than it is in Detroit.\n\nThis Old Timer's Boofay is run sublimely compared to the metrocenter location. The service level and the quality of the food coming out of the kitchen is drastically in a different league.  \n\nFood is still pretty generic - lot's of starches and cheeses and such to fill you up.  \nThere seems to be a bit more pride of execution here.  Yeah, I know, it's a chain buffet, practically a cafeteria.  No matter.  What many folks don't realize is the amount of food dishes in a place like this that are prepared in a traditional, homestyle way.  Things like homemade salad dressings, madaroni and cheese casseroles, etc. \nThey do it to save money.  Reult is fresh, homestyle food for you. So they made it in a batch to serve 30 families, so what. \n\nBreakfast is the real deal here, and around $6 if you skip the overpriced drink. Huge selection of all the favorites, and they're busy enough that it stays fresh.\n\nI can't wait to be old enough to get my seniour discount here.\n\nInside of this svelt, healthy body is trapped the wrinkly, grumpy soul of a 68 year old man.  \n\nYou kids get the hell off my lawn."
4,"Great, fresh food and excellent service. They never disappoint. A perfect place to be a \""regular\"". They always remember what we like to eat and serve with a smile."
1,"Watch out!  This place has undergone a SERIOUS change.  \n\nI decided to have a nice steak dinner.  I wanted something slightly upscale but local.  Of course I jumped on Yelp and went searching.  A friend had mentioned Onyx before so I looked it up.   Good reviews... and a special coupon to purchase.  $30 off for $15 seemed like a great deal so I bought it right here on Yelp and off I went to Onyx.\n\nWhen we arrived, the place seemed TOO quiet.  We parked right up front, across form the door, and in the shade.  We walked and turned away from the bar into the upscale Onyx.  YIKES!  Gone are the tablecloths, waiters, and customers.  We are greeted by the bartender who cautions us that they have a new menu.  I ask, is this still Onyx?  He replies that it is but cautions me that the menu is much smaller and I might have trouble spending the $30 on my coupon.  Uh oh.  I thought about leaving, but I am already $15 invested into this meal.  \n\nNo more steaks or even entrees.  The menu consists of appetizers, pizza's, and sandwiches.  We order the crispy taco appetizer and onion soup to start.  The tacos were good... they should be as it took them 20 minutes to make.  The onion soup never came at all.  Then onto the main course.  We both order pizza's.  After a good 30 minutes....  THIRTY MINUTES....   the food arrives.  A word of warning...  if you order pizza here you better like parmigiana.  The pizza was LOADED with it.  It was really 90% of the taste.  The crust and sauce were OK... but they were overpowered.  Even if you love parmigiana, you are likely to be disappointed in the pizza.  They couldn't sell this in NY for a nickel.  \n\nOverall the food was disappointing and the atmosphere depressing.  No more live music.  No more tablecloths.  No more restaurant... really.  I guess they couldn't make it as a real restaurant and now are some sort of  cheap poker bar menu... but without the poker bar (unless you go to the other room... bogeys).  Honestly, I don't know why the owner just doesn't make one big poker bar.  The Onyx is dead folks.  Move along...  nothing to see here."
2,"Just tried this place out yesterday as I've been looking for a good Chinese buffet in the area. I just moved here a few months ago and wanted to compare it to places back home. I'm giving a solid 3 stars.\n\nThis is probably the largest Chinese buffet I've been to. You pay upfront, so our lunch for 2 cost just over $22 with drinks, not including tip. Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks). \n\n\nMy favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\n\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \n\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \n\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine. \n\nI rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills. Other than that, it was pretty mediocre. I've been to way better Chinese buffets back home in Illinois, so it's nothing too special for my taste buds."
0,"Used to be my hobby store of choice.  I bought several RC cars and parts from them.  I have also referred people there to buy drones and RC cars.  I now cannot recommend Hobby Action.  Must be under a lot of pressure these days.  Customer service is now nonexistent and if you are a novice forget about it..  Yes, they have a lot of parts but their customer service is horrible.  Spoke to the owner about it today and his favorite word is policy and he was raising his voice at me.  Not customer friendly..  I walked out and will never be back.  Several other stores understand how to treat a loyal customer."
3,"I have been enjoying the massages with hot rocks and great service for over a year now and yes, I'm a fan. My last visit I tried a gel manicure and now I'm a convert. The manicure I received 9 days ago, still looks pristine, shiny. The application process is more involved and takes a little longer that the standard manicure but for only 10 dollars more - it is so worth it."
0,"Went there two times...totally disappointed. Super over price, food sucks especially the sushi, not many choices...totally dun worth $35 per person! Dun go here... go wicked spoon at cosmopolitan. Brunch only $22. Nice place, good food, many choices."
0,"I don't review places often, but felt in this situation this place needed to be placed back in reality. Yes, they do display fun designs on instagram and overall seem to have a pretty good review, I am just going off of my experience. I had a scheduled trip home for the holidays and decided to give this place a shot. For one it was not relaxing and the two woman working near me were talking amongst themselves about the other female customer (of course not in english). Pedicure did not even come close to what you would get at any other salon. I still had dry skin and it wasn't a relaxing, massage experience I was expecting. The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day. A regular pedicure and gel manicure cost me $93 plus $10 tip with Winnie. Not my style. Will never go back. Horrible management. Good luck!"
0,"Well, the extra star is really for the fact that I love our front-loader washer and dryer and that they were on sale. Didn't go to our regular Lowe's (Ray Rd) as they didn't have the models in stock. Absolutely disgusted and appalled at their customer service or lack thereof when it came to the delivery and installation. We were told they would call us Saturday morning to confirm our delivery slot. To err on the side of caution, we even called to confirm Friday night. Three phone calls later on Saturday morning, we come to find out that our order isn't even ON THE TRUCK! Seriously?! To add insult to injury, the \""manager\""  (I use this term loosely),had the audacity to ask if he could deliver it tomorrow! Absolutely unreal. So it's now noon, we still don't have our new appliances nor any idea of when they will be delivered. What an absolute joke and waste of a perfectly good Saturday. Thanks Lowe's, just how I wanted to spend my weekend, waiting for you jokers to get your crap together. Thumbs down!!!! Do not recommend the Chandler Road to anyone! We have always been very loyal to Lowe's and this seriously makes me think about switching our alliances to home depot!"
4,"Awesome place for a day drinking adventure or just a good, fun night!! Walking in, this can be extremely deceiving. It's dark wood and somewhat old school. But it has a pool table and some fun games with a small bar in the corner. Where the real fun comes is when you step out back. They have ping pong and corn hole as well as fire pits patio seating and a bar out back. Tons of TVs an they keep this back area pretty heated in the colder months  \n\nOverall this is a really cool bar. Locals are often found here as it is situation just outside of downtown. The area has tons of restaurants but Thomas street offers a full menu as well.  a must go if you live in Charlotte."
3,Nice layout of the casino. Lots of slot machines that aren't in other casinos. Like Yahtzee. The bathrooms are clean as well. Lots of delicious eaterys. The convention rooms are expansive and the halls have comfortable seating thru out.
1,"\""One Of My Least Favorite\""\nI generally aim for the more upscale casino's to not only gamble at but to also stay inside the hotel as well. I find these type of low budget casinos to be a bit past outdated and I guess for anybody who is on a budget that likes ancient egyptian theme's should opt for the Luxor!"
0,"Every time I purchase a groupon from Danny's Car Wash there seems to be a technical glitch.  This time I came in with one of the receipts/vouchers generated by Danny's when I turned in my groupon certificate.  They said the car wash had already been used.  Really?  How could i have used it multiple times if you generate the ticket from your register?  To top it off, I always have to go back through and have them vaccuum the car a second time and touch up spots they miss when wiping down the interior of the car. I'm not talking about hidden spots!  I'm talking about lifting the floor mats and getting ALL of the dirt under them.  Or really cleaning the interior coffee mug holders that have obvious coffee cup stains.  I am on the hunt for a new car wash in North Scottsdale."
3,We stopped for a late night dinner at the Great Dane Brew Pub on our way to Chicago. It had a nice atmosphere; I could definitely see us spending a lot of time here if we lived in the area. I am not a beer drinker but I did love their root beer. My husband *loves* beer and really enjoyed all of the ones that he tried.  My pot pie was delicious and my husband's burger was really good. If we ever find ourselves in the area again we would go back for sure.
4,"Fresh ingredients, good service, wonderful favors. Simple concept that works. Wife had phenomenal turkey sandwich' I had great French toast friends had roast beef sandwich and an appetizer cheese plate with something else that I missed.  If you are a person that likes a huge stack of pancakes, with four eggs and bunch of bacon as a minimum for breakfast this is wrong for you.  The portions are modest but filling for me.  This is about the taste not the poundage.\nWe went for brunch and my screwdriver had fresh squeezed OJ    The Bloody Mary's  Were great   Oh and split an order of fries.  Not a lot of tables but lots of space at bar.  And it is expensive.  But there are other expensive breakfast spots in the area that have disappointed me.  This one doesn't disappoint.  Best thing about our brunch was no adults brought their awful  obnoxious horrible children  So nice to have quiet adults.  I have children in their 20s. I never took them anywhere before they could behave.  I can't wait for my grandchildren to b  here. But they will be polite before they go to a restaurant.  This has nothing to do with cafe bink.  Everything to do with civility   Your child or grandchild is hideous.  Leave them at home when they visit from Minnesota   They suck. Seriously. Everyone hated them on the flight also.  And your wife /daughter whatever is fat and making excuses for not parenting"
0,0 STARS. This dairy queen is horrible. The employees do not know how to do their job. Completely disorganized and not clean. It took three employees to ring my order up. Corporate needs to review this shit hole of a store.
4,"Walked in at 3:30PM on Friday to see if they could fix a failed network component external power supply that appeared to have bad capacitors.\n\nAfter the gentleman at the ERC front desk popped the cover open and looked at what they were dealing with I was quoted a reasonable price for them to try to fix it and asked if I wanted to leave it with them or wait. I decided to wait.\n\nERC fixed the power supply by replacing capacitors and had me back out the door in about 25 minutes on a Friday. I was able to get back to my office in time to install the repaired power supply on the network device without any interruption to the start of my weekend.\n\nI will definitely be giving ERC my business for these types of repairs in the future. If they can fix it it's cheaper, faster and easier than used/refurb parts from eBay or unknown internet vendors and hoping the item is as described."
1,"Food is average, but the ordering process is absolutely terrible. Technology gone wrong. Doubt I'll be back"
4,"This Indonesian food cart is AMAZING.  Not only one of my favorite food carts, but easily one of the top lunch options in the entire city in my opinion.  Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\n\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\n\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\n\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\n\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \n\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.  I am *racking* my brain and I cannot think of a single reason to not send ALL of you here.  Seriously, just go.  You won't regret it!"
0,"Place is dated. There are always multiple machines broken and when machines break, they are not repaired for quite a long period of time.  Maintenance is clearly not a priority. I inquired as to why maintenance was not a priority but received no response.   Do not join unless you get tour with manager  and discuss maintenance with manager and get comfortable the situation will change.  You do get access at other clubs around country, so I am able to go to other 24 hour fitness facilities and have found other facilities much more acceptable."
3,"The only problem with our Saturday in Montreal is that by 6 p.m., we'd caved to the temptation of a great breakfast, steak frites lunch and afternoon cocktails and snacks.  For us, Le Sarah B was the perfect stop for the evening \""meal\"" - Rose and chicken wings!    Those wonderful chicken wings, perfectly seasoned and fried.  Recommended seating is around the corner behind the curtains - banquettes and pillows invite one to respectably sluggardize.  Bok bok!"
0,"Went to get my dog's food at the Pet Food Depot (Cave Creek/Grovers) and I saw a bunny in a cage on the floor, scared. He/she had food and a carrot but no water. I told an employee and after a bunch of \""that's not my rabbit\"" comments, finally someone gave the bunny water. The sweet young man who checked me out told the manager that a customer wanted to buy 2 parakeets. The manager said to put them in a paper bag because they're out of boxes...really, a paper bag? The young man said the customer specifically wanted the birds in a box and the manager said \""we don't have any boxes, should I grab one from the sky\"" and walked off. What a huge turn-off! I found out that the manager is the owner's son. \nI have been coming here for 8 years and this was my last trip here. There is a store a little further away (Western Ranchman at 32nd St/Paradise) that sells the same specialty dog food I buy, so they will be getting my business from now on. I have always been treated well here but after the flippant comments from the staff in front of a loyal customer, they obviously do not care about me or the animals they sell."
1,"Customer service is a big issue here. Once you walk in you wait for a long time. One customer was getting irritated with them because he kept waiting and not getting his to go order. Some of the customers were just ignored and walked out because they couldn't wait anymore. Quality of their food is decent but the customer service needs to be fixed. When you see multiple people leaving their tables it will hurt your business. I think the biggest problem at this place is leadership and lack of leadership skills. Also waitress should never tell other customers \""oh that guy is mad at me\"", because he waited long time for his order. I just don't think it's professional."
2,"Gotta give Sparky some credit for their free bumper stickers, \""Stop staring at my cones\"" Well I didn't get a cone, but I still tried a cup of ice cream. I guess I thought since it said Gourmet, I didn't realize that the place is really just a Stone-Cold with a bit fancier ice cream. I sampled Brown Sugar Maple Bacon, but didn't taste much and German Choc. cake was only Ok. Finally settled on a pretty decent scoop of cinnamon ice fream with two mixin's ($5...one was free and the other cost me an extra $1 because I donated for holidays). The chocolate chips and chopped pecans made this a tasty treat, but the best ice cream on the planet usually does not include mixing stuff into the treat. It's just a preference, but yogurt gets the toppings, but ice cream should be ready to go from the bins."
3,"I think this place is great. It's a unique little spot. However, some of these reviews are expecting too much. First, you're going for a $10 wine tasting for five wines, you shouldn't expect Opus One. The wines are priced appropriately and the concept of bottling parties is such a great idea for an event. Also, 'carry & go' is a perfect idea in this area. \n\nThe wines are not offensive. If you are a wine connoisseur, then you will appreciate that these are young wines, but typically are pleasing to the palate. \n\nI have always found the staff to be extremely friendly. Also, I agree with Gabbi, that they get props for being doggie friendly!!"
0,Not going to explain. Just don't waste your time.
1,"This is a neat, unique restaurant, but not one item was worth the price. This restaurant is not fine dining, so to pay six bucks for four onion rings seemed off to me."
2,It's somewhat ok. Seems clean enough. Don't use powder detergent though. At least not on the front loaders the fans blow all the time and that powder will get blown in your face. They need to work on more places to sit too. Not always easy to sit outside when it's hot or you're pregnant and need to get off your feet.
2,"It's chilly here - so please where a jacket!  \n\nThe station is going under major refurbishment, so please bear with it.  \n\nIt has a ticket office, toilets and various shops to get any last minute shopping before you hop on that train. \n\nLooking forward to seeing the completion of works."
2,"I like this Basha's.... its local, and convenient. I don't tink they are the cheapest place in town to shop... but it's around the corner from where I live. \n\nI also like supporting local Arizona business.\n\nThe staff at this Basha's is always very friendly, and I like to frequent one store so you get to know the staff."
1,"To avoid the pouring rain, we ran into this place to have a drink.  I got a dirty martini and my friend got some fruity drink.  I was unimpressed.  My martini glass was tiny and it was barely halfway full.  There was literally 2 spoonfuls of liquid in that tiny glass.  That would have been okay for $9 if I were surrounded by hot bodies in tight shirts dancing on white sofas.  In which case the goddamn drink woulda been free.  But this ain't Hollywood honey.  When I pay $9 for a drink I expect more than an eyedropper's worth."
0,"There are a few issues with this place.\nThe obvious is the entirely unacceptable wait for food. I ordered on GrubHub (which I do often) at 2:18pm, my estimated delivery was 3:45pm-3:55pm\nSeemed a little long but its BBQ and red velvet cake with corn bread and mac n cheese so has to be worth some wait, and I am near a college campus so OK.\n\n4:00pm rolls by and I call the restaurant. At first it goes directly to VM. OK, this isn't good so I call again and I get put on hold. Once the gentlemen finally picks up Im told it will be 15-20 minutes for my order and he apologizes for the delay. OK no problem.\n\nI decide to hop on Yelp and look at the reviews, as when I ordered I was starving so just picked a place (I'm still starving as I write this first part). I see the wait is not uncommon. In fact its the norm.\n\n4:20pm rolls by and I message GrubHub. Within 2 minutes I had a text and email stating I should have my food by 4:32pm ...its 4:29pm as I type this. They gave me an extra 10.00 in food, which I appreciate and realize its not their fault my food is late but with all these issues piling up you would think they might get the hint to discontinue business with this place. (Just sayin).\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo food got here at: 4:37\n\n\nReview of food:\n\nHot Links - Sauce was spicy and good so was the hotlink the bun was crunchy on the edges link it was over microwaved.\n\nMac N Cheese - Bland. Its a shame too there is so much you can do with Mac N Cheese.\n\nCornbread Muffin - Decent taste, horrible consistency. I don't expect my Cornbread to be chewy.\n\nRed Velvet Cake - Cake was moist and it was good but it had an after taste like the cream cheese had been wrapped in plastic wrap too long\n\n\nAll in all I wont order here again, the food was not great and the time it took to get here was utterly poor."
2,"It wasn't horrible and it wasn't mind-blowing. Average burger with steep prices (well, you are in Vegas). We were really hungry and on our way to the Secret Garden at the Mirage. Limited combo options, if you choose a special burger then the price of the friesa and drink skyrocket the bill. The milkshake was dense and tasty, but half the cup was frosting (which I don't really care for). Simple and clean presentation. The server was timely and attentive. She didn't hover too much or ignore us. I liked the house pickles (mild brine). Honestly, for the price, I would have rather paid for a restaurant experience at a Master Chef restaurant or something."
3,This place is really cool. So many birds. The shows were very interesting as well. The food court has some good pizza too.
4,Super!  When you team Chef Kelly Fletcher with Sommelier David M Johnson you know you're going to experience magic. Achiote Salmon was a great flavor festival in my mouth.  We also tried the braised short rib which as good as we have ever had. Love the creativity of the food and the large (and well priced) wine list. Check it out!!
2,I love whole foods but this location has the basics.  The products and help is the normal 4/5 stars but this is one of the smaller locations I have seen. Their deli still has all the goodies you would expect from whole foods. Still it is better than not having a whole foods at all like most of Wisconsin.
0,"Horrible service. Came here with my 13 yr old daughter. Took 30 minutes to get a bowl of garlic fries, almost an hour to get our food. Waitress was more interested in socializing with the tables of loud, obnoxious drunks, than serving a dad and his daughter. Even had to wait to pay my bill. Finally got up and paid my bill at the front desk. Food quality has gone way down since I started coming here a few years ago."
1,4stars to DJ !!! \nI got hyped by the music that DJ played for us.\nHe played songs that are mixed from old funk to pop songs.\nTransition between songs is really smooth. \n\n0 stars for the bar. Cocktails were not worth the price.\n\n(4+0)/2=2 stars
1,"My family and I were here staying at a near by Hotel and decided to go here, plus it was my husbands birthday. We got right in for a Saturday night. We ordered the sampler appetizer. This had no flavor. It was so bland. Then my husband ordered the chicken and broccoli pasta. He couldn't even eat it, it was so bland. No spices, no taste. I tried it and I couldn't even eat it. We sent it back. I got the top sirloin and it was basically a piece of fat that had been grilled. The kids didn't even eat their food. (One had chicken fried steak and the other kid ribs) I felt so bad for my husband because he had a terrible birthday dinner meal. We ended up paying our bill, and getting snacks afterwards to compensate. The service was good, but not attentive. We will not ever visit another Claim Jumper again."
3,"Took my father here for his birthday and it was quite the experience.  L'atelier is famous for its open kitchen.  They give their guests the option of sitting at the bar where they can overlook the open kitchen and watch all the chefs cooking their food.  My father and I each ordered the Discovery Menu for $168.  Seems a little pricey for a 1 Michelin Star restaurant, but hey...it is JR.\n\nThe Discovery Menu consisted of 10 courses (including coffee).  There was a lot of foie gras in the menu that evening and my cholesterol level felt like it was going to rocket out of the building after the meal.  But the foie gras was cooked very well and full of flavor.  I was very impressed with the Langoustine carpaccio.  It was my first time having Langoustine and I really enjoyed it with the combination of spices.  The Dover sole filet wasn't anything too special though.\n\nWe also shared an order of the le'burger, L'atelier's signature burger.  It consisted of a kobe beef patty with foie gras and WOW was that delicious.  The best burger I have ever had, I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who visits L'atelier.\n\nThe service was also very good and attentive here.  Always making sure we didn't have an empty glass of water and the waiters are were very willing to make small talk.  Seeing that it was my father's birthday, at the end of the meal they presented us with a selection of 6 different kinds of dessert cakes, all of which were delicious.\n\nThe price is what stopped me from giving this restaurant 5 stars, but my father and I still enjoyed our meal very much."
1,"I would give this \""Urban Grocery\"" a better rating if their hours were better!  Being closed on Sunday and Monday, two of the most common \""oops, I forgot something and need to go to the grocery store\"" days, is not the best idea.  It's great that this place is within walking distance of our home, but their stock just isn't that great.  I'm glad that I can get Hickman's eggs there, but I wish that they used Superstition Farm milk instead of the ubiquitous Shamrock.  SuperFarm's milk tastes better and lasts longer.  They have an interesting selection of produce, and I realize it's still growing, but we live in AZ so stuff like berries are not to be expected.  Bummer.  They carry some stuff that I will purchase every so now and then like the AZ Cheesecake Co. treats and the bread from Scottsdale, but that's about it."
1,"Tried it once w/ the kids, won't be back.\nNot bad, but for their high prices and the quality, there are better choices in LV.\n\nNoise level is high."
0,"Been going to this location for over a year now  Last week i ordered griled chicken breast on rye bread. They brought it to me on regular bun. I noticed human hair on the chicken. Thats gross! I could have a big seen but i didnt in front of his customers.\nToday it was brezzy do i took my mccaw, into store. Ordered the same sandwich as last week again they could not get it right the first time. Then the mgr comes to my table and says my bird cannot be in the store. I told him i wanted my money back. And that i would never return to his resturant  . This owner discrimated against a 2.5 lb animal that brings smiles to countlesss people everyday. He wasnt hurting anybody. \nThis proprietor, was extremely condensending,rude & obnoxious. \nShame on Freedies Custard on Eastern Ave Las Vegas, NV."
3,This Loblaws is good. Avoid peek times because the queues become unbearable.
2,Went there this morning for breakfast. Both the Lox and bagel were delicious but they were very chinsey on lox. Had to order a side of lox where we were given a slice and a quarter for $7. Silly no point!  Should give enough to cover two pieces of a bagel no one makes a sammy. \nThanks
4,"this shop is 100% fantastic!!! \n\nmy friend and i made the trip out from the strip after she raved about the fresh turkey sub she'd had with her husband a year ago. besides some really roundabout directions, the trip was definitely worth the short drive out from the main strip! \nreasons to make your way out to this shop:\n-the turkey is roasted fresh every day and melts in your mouth!\n-during the time we were there, people from NY, Philly, California, and Texas came by, put the philly sandwich to the test, AND loved it!\n-Ruth is one of the sweetest people i met and makes you feel like you're family! \n\nRuth, BEST 12 inches i've ever had!!! ;)"
3,"I came to this trendy yet casual restaurant for happy hour (Sun-Fri from 5:30pm - 7:00pm).  To order off the happy hour menu, you have sit at the cocktail tables or the bar.  Because the kitchen is open, you can see the chefs preparing your food, which is always legit.  That being said, I was quite surprised and alarmed to see the chefs eating in the kitchen while preparing the food.  Service was lightning fast, as I was in and out within a half hour.\n\nTime to get happy.\n\nThe white sangria ($5), which also comes in red, was awesome and was so good that I was forced to order another one.\n\nThe raw oysters in a half shell ($2 each) were sold by the half dozen and came with every dipping sauce under the sun.  I've had a lot of oysters in my day and I highly recommend checking these out.\n\nThe stuffed clams ($5) were ginormous.  Stuffed with chorizo, they were served with grilled buttered bread.  The clams were simply amazing.  \nWith just the right amount of salty and savory, they were smooth in texture and easy to chew.\n\nNow for the most expensive appetizer ever.  The poppers ($22) weren't on the happy hour menu and came with 3 tuna balls and 3 yellowtail balls, each served raw on top of fried rice patties.  These bad boys lived up to their name and were small enough to pop in your mouth.  Though not worth the price, they were still pretty dank.\n\nFocus on the seafood at this place and definitely enjoy!"
3,"I'd like to become a regular here. Especially at the bar. It's well stocked with good liquors and a big selection of Belgian and Belgian-style beers. The bartenders are friendly. The atmosphere is dark and rustic/charming. The patio is intimate with a nice fireplace and heaters with large comfy couches. The food is great, though it takes quite a long time for it to come out after you order it. My boyfriend and I had the burger- moist, perfectly cooked, and with great flavor. We also split the challah french toast. It was very good as well. This place is exactly what I'd like in a neighborhood bar."
4,"Loved this place!\n\nI went for lunch after my graduation.  We went for a very late lunch so it was dead, which was fine with me.  We had a great server, who was accomodating and friendly.  The mac and cheese was SO GOOD, definitely get that if you go.  We also had the grilled artichokes.. very yummy.\n\nEveryone's lunch was good, and I thought was really reasonably priced for 5 people (3 ordered the kobe burgers, a bottle of champagne, and two appetizers) when the total came out to $115 bucks.\n\nThey also provided a free celebration dessert, which was such a nice personal touch.\n\nFood = yummy, decor = adorable, service = excellent."
4,"I recently needed A/C repair on a Monday morning following the first really\nhot weekend in Phoenix.  Apparently, a LOT of other people needed A/C repair, also.\nMy regular repairman was unavailable.  I called A/C Guys, Inc.  (found on Yelp)\nThis was a rental property.  An appointment needed to be scheduled with the tenant, while keeping me (the landlord) aware of what was going on.  Payment needed to be scheduled with me.  Technician needed to inform both the tenant and me as to what was going on with the A/C.  A/C Guys handled all of this with ease, and kept me informed\nat all times. So easy.  \nIn addition, the technician (Matt) gave me two options for repair (I have never had THAT happen before - nice).  In the office (Ty) coordinated it all, and e-mailed me a receipt.\nProfessional business, honest, great repair, and affordable prices.  I highly recommend this business, and will continue to use A/C Guys, Inc. in the future."
0,Food took an HOUR to get to us.  Then it was cold but we were too hungry to send it back and have them spit in it.  I really enjoyed this place when it was in Mesa but they just lost a customer.  Horrible.
2,"The epicenter ale is very good.  We just had to take some home so we ordered a six pack to go.  This place is a lot like Four Peaks in Tempe except  the food is a little more expensive (beer prices are similar though).  The food isn't as good as Four Peaks so we will go there over this place from now on but I wouldn't tell people to stay away...try it, it's OK"
3,"I needed a quick lunch while buzzing around Phoenix. I have heard a lot of good things about Zoe's and since I was there,I thought I would give it a go!\nParking can be tight, at lunch time at least. Lots of people have the same idea.\nI got a simple lunch,but it was very good.\nLimeade was my drink of choice, quite good and they say sweetend with Cane sugar.\nI got the Zoe Club Pita. Was fresh tatsing as good.\nChicken, Ham ,and swiss cheese, with lettuce ,tomato and some spicy mustard, I asked for extra spice.\nNot a bad experiance at all. The place is clean and modern looking."
4,"5 stars by far place is super busy but worth the wait! Food is great staff is friendly, and accommodating. Seating area is small but the kitchen is open to watch them cook. First  and only hawaiian bbq place I'll eat at. If you are picky like me it's a big step to try it but I wasn't disappointed!"
1,"Poor and inconsistent service.   \n\nRates are high with requirements other rental companies dont have not to mention it was like they were doing me a favor for me to spend 600 bucks with them. \n\n Don't even try to rent if you use a debit card need everything from references, utility statements and first born. \n\nRecommend checking other rental agencies that appreciate return customers and more than likely have better rates."
1,"Yes, it's a Las Vegas Buffet - Food here is meh - basically, low quality food with emphasis of quantity. It is pretty pricy considering what you're getting - traditional Vegas up charge, but I still think it's still a bit pricy, even by Vegas Standards. \n\nMe, I just had a couple of eggs, canned fruit, and a bowl of cereal. Personally in the future, if I have to eat on the cheap and quick - I would suggest considering a coffee shop oatmeal, fruit, and coffee. Or if you want to spend the budget - consider eating a famous French place that is listed in my Vegas list."
4,"What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.\n\nThe atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the \""wine cellar\"" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.\n\nMonday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. \n\nThe first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.\n\nI do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm. It was DEAD. For Phoenix, this is a truly unique dining option. Roka is a great option for dinner before going out to Old Town, or a great spot to get together with friends to celebrate."
3,"Be sure u go to the right location, Bethany Home & 16th. Next to Dick's Hideaway"
2,"The buffet was good. It's probably one of the price-friendly ones. It honestly didn't cost me an arm and a leg. With the remodeling done there, it was a little hard to find the buffet. It's underground... kinda-sorta. The hosts don't really pay attention to the people eating and randomly changing tables. So, it gets annoying if you have a party of 6 and this party of 4, who's already on their 3rd plates, decide to move to a roomier table. Yeah, not cool.\n\nADVISORY:\nGet there early, in a blink of an eye... the lines are crazy."
1,"I usually am quite the fan of Uswirl. I come here once every two weeks or so. On 6/4 at 9PM I walked in with my family to get some frozen yogurt. The service was TERRIBLE. There was nearly NO fruit toppings out and when I asked the girl at the cashier to please grab some strawberries she was on her phone and I had to call her 3 or 4 times to even get her attention. When I finally got her attention, she rolled her eyes. A kid about 15 kept walking in and out of the store and communicating with the other male worker- very unprofessional as I believe they were speaking of drugs or some type of confrontation happening across the way involving their friends. Very dissatisfied."
1,"Not bad, if you like low quality, pre-prepared school cafeteria lunch food. Make sure you ask which dish has the surprise plastic wrap hidden in it. If you find it, you're the night's winner! And the plastic is your prize!"
3,Sushi is fresh and service is great.  I just wish the place could accommodate more people.  Sometimes the wait isn't worth the time.
3,Mmmm... Beer... and the grub ain't to shabby either.\n\nWho does not like roasted peanuts with the shell and pitch them on the floor after eating the nuts?
4,"Deceive your diet! Indulge in any of the appetizers and entrees knowing your feeding your body with something that's not only nutritious but tastes delicious! Sure bets are the Caprese salad, Chicken Shawarma, and Pesto Lavosh Turkey Wrap. Prices are under $15 and portions are generous."
3,Get the tacos! They are awesoooome!
1,"I though it was overpriced, the steak was good, but not great. There are plenty of great steakhouses in Vegas that are better for half the price."
0,"This place needs to close.  Half the waitresses are tweekers with missing teeth.  Our server must have have been on meth, she messed up the entire order.  I talked to the manager, Javier, about the service, and he said \""what do you want me to do about it?\""  This Applebees has seen better days."
4,Tried a few of the manicurists here before I settled with Cecilia. Meticulous quality!
2,"I've been here several times and tried the chimichanga, street tacos, and the pollo fun dido. The chimi and tacos are just ok. A little flat in flavor. The fun dido is real tasty with a good kick and a lot of cheese. Their complimentary chips n salsa are delicious and they give you a variety with flour and corn chips!  The margarita is very good but a little light In the tequila zone. I'd like to give them a 4 star if it wasn't for the rather inflated prices, but I suppose they're in the right area for it in n. Scottsdale. I will be back but will most likely get a beer instead of the cocktail."
1,"Do not move here!!! my wife and i were looking for a nice place to live in vegas and i thought this would be the spot... we rented for a year so we could find the right house to buy... Thank god i am only locked in here for 6 more months... it is a section 8 community, so now i pay full price for my house but all my neighbors do not... Its not fair and i have to listen to them fight all the time about drugs and have seen 2 physical fights as well... Security does nothing but tells you to call Metro... Save your time and money and look somewhere else... The golf course has gone downhill too, they give out 3 months of unlimited golf for $69, so that brought all the right crowds here too... There are plenty more communities that are safer than this and do not have section 8... ( section 8 housing in a gated community is a oxymoron... )"
4,"We loved everything about Frost! The service was great and the Gelato speaks for itself, absolutely delicious! We especially loved that everything was made fresh on site and does not contain preservatives.  Friendly staff and a clean store. Definitely a place we plan to visit more often."
3,"We came here on a Thursday night with a large group of 20 plus.  The place was extremely accomodating in that they let us form our own impromptu groups/seating.  The service was great.  The servers checked-in on us as a group and individually.  Without even asking, they kept all our bills separately which made settling the check a breeze.  Trust me, that is a huge undertaking in group settings.  Decent list of wine selections.  The pizza was delicious.  Definitely a cool chill place to be if you want to get away from the craziness everywhere else on Mill."
4,"So glad that I can update my review to now be 5 star. Foonzo went through a couple of changes as they were testing out to see what worked and what didn't, now that it works, oh damn does it work!!! They now have more beer choices, a fully stocked bar, and a full kitchen. Prices have leveled out and having a super competent and adorable waitress was also a great change! I uploaded the food / drink menus in the photos, I tend to judge restaurants on the \""different\"" dishes, such as veggie burgers. I can confirm that their veggie burger is DELICIOUS. They have the perfect marinade, and dipping in their BBQ sauce made me glad I ordered the veggie over the pattie and bacon (this coming from a carnivore). Their beer buckets are perfect for keeping your table in order and their \""drop shots\"" are an inexpensive little party round (try the Chupacabra - tequila & Monster). They also have a nerdy-named martini menu which is a nice touch. So excited to come here regularly and master my gaming skills."
1,"Never again!!\nNobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere. \nIt took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch, and no imported draft).\nThe uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample, who cares to eat a bunch of slop.\nI've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year.\nI guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas.\nGo to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged.\nCaveat Emptor"
0,"absolutely awful the fish and chips was on a par with Long John Silvers, $6-25 for a bottle of Harp, $30-00 total and the skank waitress after I left $40-00 to cover it asked \""do you want change\"" well duh I ain't leaving 33.333% for something that should have cost $10 max jeez avoid at all costs !"
0,"Dr. Lepore is amazing. Expertise, bedside manner, etc: amazing. The rest of the operation, however, is not.\n\nKidfixers stops being spectacular as soon as you attempt to contact them outside the office. If you call them during business hours they will not pick up. So you leave a message that they will never respond to. Sometimes they leave hilariously frustrating messages like \""Call back during business hours.\"" After you called and left a message first thing in the morning. They do this consistently day after day. \n\nIf your kid gets sick just take them in, if you can get worked in, and if you do there's an extremely good chance you'll not see Dr. Lepore, who is the whole reason you should go here. If you try and call the emergency line, even for something basic like a mild fever, they're answer is going to be \""make an appointment.\"" So just go in.\n\nAnd should a pharmacy or insurance representative call or fax the office do not worry, the staff consistently and thoroughly ignores all these requests. So should even the slightest hiccup occur with anything, Kidfixers will forget you exist.\n\nDr. Lepore is a great physician, however his clinic cannot be relied on to do anything. I would recommend this place to people who enjoy waiting days to never be contacted while their children suffer with treatable illnesses."
1,"We were a party of five looking for a light meal.  Several of us initially selected the happy hour special of soup and grilled cheese, but the tomato bacon soup apparently is very spicy, which didn't appeal to members of my party. When we looked closer at the menu, it appeared that a lot of the dishes involved a lot of peppers...and a lot of goat cheese. \n\nAnyway, I took advantage of the happy hour beer specials, but unfortunately I really hated the second beer (something by Deschutes that I think might have been skunked). Our server disappeared for the first of several times; another server ended up getting me a different drink.\n\nTwo members of my group ordered quesadillas, one chicken and one steak; when the runners brought one to the table, they said, \""here's a chicken quesadilla...or steak, I don't really know,\"" and plopped it down. My squash spaghetti arrived several minutes after everyone else's dishes. My dish was underwhelming: the goat cheese (of course!) was congealed in clumps (as one might have expected), the sauce was very oily, and the dish had no discernible seasoning. \n\nAfter we had finished, our plates lingered for far too long. Once we received the check, we actually never saw our initial server again, having to flag down another server to get our credit card processed.\n\nI'm not really sure what this place is going for. At the price point for dinner, the food and service need to be much better than it is."
4,"Open until 2AM!!\n\nPhoenix for some reason is lacking on late night dining. This is why I give Delux gets five stars. The food amazing and ambiance up-to-date, open until 2AM seven day a week."
4,"Yes, this is, indeed, the best market in the city.  The only way you could do better is to go to a farm stand at a farm and/or pick your own.  This is like the convention of the best and most well known and most local farmers there are in the area.  In supplement, some of the best stuff is brought in from California  So take your pick: super local direct from your farmers, or semi-local but exotic and fresh and brought to you with love and care by Kerry."
3,"We love sushi and we have been to some of the best sushi places in most of the major cities in the US and Canada. We are always looking for good sushi at a good price. So after getting a discounted gift certificate from restaurant.com we decided to try Cafe Wasabi. It's located in a strip mall but is nicely appointed inside. We spent a good while looking at the countless rolls available which were all pictured across the counter. This is perfect for those people who like to see what they are about to eat. We ordered a several different rolls and nigiri to sample it all. \nWe spent about $70 for a two adults and 2 small kids. Good thing we had that gift certificate. Overall, the sushi was very good and the service was good. Again they have a great selection to choose from and I am looking forward to sampling more of the options."
2,"I want to give 2.5 stars but that's not an option so just imagine I did.  2.5 stars, here we go....\n\nWe went for a walk last night around our neighborhood and this place caught my eye because of the sign that said \""Well Wednesday\"" all well drinks $3!  Ok, in we went.  It was pretty dead so we were seated right away.  Whiskey and Coke for him and Whiskey Sour for me.  They came out quick, were decent sized but my Sour lacked a cherry which is a minor detail but I secretly really wanted one.\n\nWe decided to share the Fish and Chips cause we weren't super hungry, it was ok.  The fries were better than the fish I thought.  We got talked into dessert and chose the Bread and Butter pudding.  This is where 2 of the 2.5 stars come from.  It was AMAZING, warm with raisins some kind of heavenly sauce and whipped cream.  Yum.  One more drink was ordered and we got our bill.\n\nThey charged $2 extra for an extra plate because we shared the meal.  This makes me mad because they didn't state this beforehand.  If I didn't make it obvious we were sharing and just ate off the one plate would you have added the $2?  As my Dad would say because of that it's an OTOTO.  One time, one time only kind of place!"
0,Been waiting forever to order something and others said they have been here for almost an hour with no food yet
2,"It was just ok. For 10 bucks for lunch with a drink I had hoped it would be a little better. I had hibachi beef, which seemed like some low grade cut, no sirloin here. Shrimp sauce and rice was good. Carrot slices and broccoli were both very tiny. Not horrible, but for the money there are much better work lunch options around here."
3,"When I take my family to Vegas they get together and look up Vegas buffets to try. We got an all day passes for the Las Vegas Flamingo, Paris, Harris, and 4 other hotels for 49.00 a person for a 24 hour pass with Totalrewards. If you purchase the All Day Pass at dinner time you can have Breakfasts, Lunch and Dinner the next day a good deal you think but for 4 people that's $218.00 dollars with tax. My family wanted to stay an extra couple of days so we found a good rate at The Rio. hotel. Out of all the Buffets we went to the Carnival World Buffet was the best experience and it was not even close. I have stayed at the Rio before and have always loved this buffet. They have a very large section and they have sea food too. I will say that for years this Buffet would have always gotten 5 stars from me but this last time it just seemed that it as gone down just a little but I can't put my finger on what it is. Buffets have become so high in price and there are so many Buffets in Vegas now the Rio may have let there buffet slip just a little. With that being said I still think this buffet is in the top 5 of buffets in Vegas."
0,"Requires you the purchase everything from drinks, and extra fees for people who aren't even smoking. Seriously? This place I do not recommend at all. Try a different hookah place."
3,"Third stop on an Aria/Crystals foodie crawl.  We sat down at the bar eager for some tapas and sangria.  I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.\n\nWe went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.\n\nWe also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.\n\nFinally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.\n\nA good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.\n\nCheck out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.  They pipe in some Spanish language tapes which are pretty hilarious.  Great restaurant!"
1,"Wheelhouse lounge in Casino was very slow service. \""signature\"" Fries are terrible, fresh fish sandwich good but oily, Italian sausage ok, wedding soup was tasty. Large screen sports bar is nice but drafty in the back. There is better food in the Casino, probably won't go here again.\n\nForget this place, pay a little more and go to Andrews."
3,"This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...\n\nFor lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. \n\nI ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their \""light\"" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. \n\nMy friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. \n\nAnyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then \""chopped\"" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!\n\nMy other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the \""special culinary name\"" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. \n\nI also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! \n\nSoooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple \""light\"" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? \n\nCowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20. \n\nOh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+. \n\nCan't wait to go back for dinner..."
4,"Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns, or particularly even holding one.  (My hands shake and I start feeling nauseous.) But I gotta say, after being in a few different gun shops for work...this place really takes the cake.  \n\nI agree with Dave S.  that Hyatt is a very highly respected shop.  It's in fact one of the top 10 largest in volume gun dealers in the entire country.  (One of the store employees even printed out the article to show me.) \n\nYou'll see the vast selection of firearms on the walls, in the cases...and all the employees I talked to know their stuff inside and out.  I was told the story behind machine guns, and the history behind certain handguns.  \n\nThe place is almost ALWAYS packed (even on Black Friday...when they don't offer any discounts/sales) and what I admire is how the salespeople take their time with each customer no matter how busy it is.  The fact the customers all wait patiently and don't get mad...now that's loyalty."
1,The smells are wonderful.  Cannot wait to taste!  The employees are not to friendly at first. They seemed impatient when were we trying to decide on what to order.  Hope the food is outstanding to make up for the employees.\nWell sorry to say the pizza was old. We ordered a pepper and egg sandwhich and that was good.
1,"I visited tonight for the first time and ordered three rolls: a rainbow roll, volcano roll, and screaming orgasm.\n\nThey brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.\n\nThe volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.\n\nThe screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.\n\nService was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.  \n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe I'll ever come back to this place.  There are MUCH better alternatives all over town."
2,"Amazing food, horrible waitress, we asked for a teaspoon and she said they don't have any, then brings a teaspoon anyways???? Idiot! She should be fired."
2,"Like Tortilla Fish.  Very simple menu,  fish tacos (steamed or fried), shrimp tacos (fried only), a few salads and quesadillas, that's all.  No rice or beans. But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.   \n\nI did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.\n\nDining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.\n\nGood value.."
2,"Ordered delivery my first night in town.\nLoved the cheese sticks with the Garlic Butter dip. \nThe pizza was A-OK. \nIn flavor, the crust reminded me of the national pizza chain with the red white and blue logo. \nMore toppings that that chain. \nI woudl pick Toppers over that other chain."
2,"I hate to do this but I have to bring Aloha Nails down a star. Mainly because of the service I had today. \n\nFor the most part, most of the ladies are very nice and are meticulous in their work. Today, I wasn't so lucky. I usually only get a pedicure but decided to have both a manicure and pedicure. \n\nThe nail tech doing my pedicure was nice and was careful in her work. It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. \n\nWhen I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows. I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. \n\nShe asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.\n\nShe must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't. It's disappointing because I've had good service here before, a few times.\n\nI would go back to Aloha Nails because it's so convenient - maybe just for a pedicure - but I'd avoid this nail tech in the future."
3,"Saw a noodle house advertised and wondered where it was.  Been eating at Phoenix Palace for several months before I discovered China Magic.  First time we were the only patrons in the restaurant; my friend from Long Island is very particular about her Chinese food; she loves this place.  My other friend is very picky about food to begin with; but still he loves this place.  So, we brought another friend from the Philippines and he really loves this place.  Just mostly stick to the noodle dishes.  Wish the drive wasn't so far; but definately be back."
0,"Their lack of service really outweighed the quality of their food, so for that I am giving them one star (I wish I could give none).\n\nThe waitresses thoroughly pissed both me and my bf off. First of all, we were the first people to go into the restaurant at 11am. Once we entered, they looked over at us from the bar and I said \""hello\"" with a smile on my face, which was quickly turned into a scowl after they just stared at us without responding. We just stood their for 5 minutes while they kept on talking to each other at the bar. Then FINALLY one of them comes up to us and says \""yes, what can i help you with?\"" \""um, we're here for breakfast\"" is what we said. Then she told us to sit in the front without even bringing us over to a table. \n\nWe picked out what we wanted fairly quickly. We both got Cuban style breakfasts which were $8.95 each (pretty overpriced for what you get). My plate consisted of some plantains, two potato balls, two pieces of toast, and eggs....for $8.95. Which reminds me that they totally screwed up on my order. I ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy. They brought us our plates (after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we were the only customers) and both plates had over easy eggs. I didn't even bother complaining because I knew it was just going to take even longer and we were on pressed time. I felt like they just did all the eggs over easy to make it simpler for themselves. \n\nMy bf finished his plate first and he scooted his empty plate to the side of the table so the waitress could see and pick it up. Instead the waitress sat some lady that just arrived to a booth next to us and started talking to her in Spanish for a while, took her order, then walked right past our table without taking the plate or giving us and refills. Shortly after that, I finished my plate of food. At that point there were TWO empty plates at the side of the table and TWO empty cups next to them. It really ticked me off to see the waitress bring the lady's order out right away, talk to her some MORE, then pass our table ONCE AGAIN without doing anything. We were literally sitting there doing nothing. \n\nThe waitress went to the lady's table again to talk to her some more and that's when my boyfriend asked her for the bill, then she asked us if we wanted some refills and took our plates. If that's what it takes to get refills and a clean table at this place then that's just ridiculous.\n\nShe came out with not our bill, but the bill for the lady in the booth next to us. WTF that really got us mad! That lady next to us arrived about 30 minutes after we arrived.  We asked for the bill ONCE AGAIN and she brought it out along with the other lady's change. My bf slammed his card on the bill right away cuz we were not in the mood to wait any longer. \n\nAs we waited for the waitress to bring us the receipt I noticed all the other waitresses just standing around the bar DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR. That's probably what they do all day long since the bar has a wall made up of mirrors. It was so annoying, there was about 5 other waitresses and not one of them could give us good service. I noticed one of the waitresses made a stripper outfit out of her uniform. All of her tramp stamp tattoos were showing since she rolled her shirt up and she was wearing hoochi shorts, I found it very unprofessional. \n\nOur receipt finally came. I begged my bf not to give a tip, unfortunately he did lol, but it was only 5 percent. They really deserved less considering they neglected the hell out of us . \n\nI don't know if it was because of the way we looked (my bf has dreads and I have a nose piercing) but the service was just horrible and it seemed like it was only like that for us. Either way, no establishment should be run like this. \n\nWe still want to try the Cuban buffet and we plan on doing so next week. Luckily with buffets you go and get your own food, so we won't be needing much of their services. I guess then I'll be able to post something about their food. That is, if they don't make a black cloud hover over it with their service."
0,"Very bad experience at BLD this morning.  On our last vist the waitress forgot to place our order, after 30 minutes we left.  Today the service very poor and slow.  The wait staff just doesn't care about customer service.  Stopped woman manager and told her we had been waiting 35 minutes for our food.  No apologies, she brought our food and never stopped by our table thru the meal to see if everything was okay.  Too loud and too much of a bar atmophere for breakfast.  Never again and I live just down the street."
2,"We had the wristbands to go to several buffets, but staying in the Palazzo we got a little lazy the second day and went here instead of walking further down. The food here is pretty much the same as other buffets but the service was super slow.\n\nMy husband I ate breakfast here twice and both times the refills never came. We watched our waitress talking to another table about fashion. I stopped a different waitress and she said I had to wait for our waitress. okay. \n\nFinally, she came back for refills about the time we were leaving. I don't think I'd go back here just based on the slow refills, call me picky, but those buffets are not cheap. If you don't opt in for the wrist band, which pays for itself in basically two meals, then show your Harrah's card and get a discount. \n\nThey were cool enough the morning our wristbands were expired to give us lunch at breakfast pricing because it was about five minutes after they stopped serving it."
3,Hog roast goodness. \nNice stuffing.\nNice apple sauce.\nReasonably priced.\nTotal win!
3,"Great to see they have a brick and mortar location now since I last saw them under their different name (Frost Bites) and set up (a food truck at Boulder Highway)! \n\nHad green tea the first go around and settled on black sesame the second time. Both flavors were great! For ice that looks intricate and textured, it's incredibly soft to taste. It's not overtly sweet or syrupy. When I ordered black sesame, I had it with boba and gummies! The boba was good but the gummies were not soft and chewy. Even though I didn't enjoy them, they did make for an interesting photo. \n\nParking is limited so if you find it appreciate it."
3,"How could I have missed reviewing Goyemon?!?!\n\nThis place really is a secret hot spot. Definitely popular among the locals. It get packed, so arrive early and preferably during non rush hours. The wait can be killer. \n\nGoyemon has fresh sushi and great ingredients. Before eating at Goyemon, I was not a fan of Uni (sea urchin) because of the texture and flavor. Little did I know what great uni tasted like. I'm a believer. As far as their sushi goes, I'm a fan. \n\nI would recommend trying their all you can eat.Know what you want, don't be afraid to try their specials of the day. It's hard to go wrong at Goyemon. I haven't had a dish that I was not fond of. Pick what you like, highly likely you'll enjoy it.\n\nBe forewarned, their service can be a little on the slow side, but you can compensate for that by ordering a lot when they take your first order, that way you won't be like that Brian B. guy who left a stupid ass comment on this great sushi house. If I took 22 people to Sushi Sasabune, I would get horrible service too. Moron. Next time go to Todai or something."
3,"Tis good.  Very unique food.  I love the bread, it's unique.  You definitely will be full when you leave.  They also have ginger soda which is amazing."
4,"My little perforated, syrup-filled heart is full every time I come here!\n\nIt has great food and it's not too expensive. Mondays they have \""Magic Monday,\"" where you can get the breakfast magic waffle (bacon, cheese, egg on top) for $4 (maybe $5? I forget). \n\nThis place also might have my favorite breakfast potatoes in the whole city. Yeah, I said it. They are just like I want them to be: crispy on the outside and pillow-y soft on the inside, just like a french fry. This gal's no fan of soggy home fries. \n\nAnother fave is the P-wedge: a pita grilled like a waffle, slathered in cream cheese and topped with arugula, grilled tomatoes and capicola (I think you can choose other meats though, but why would you want to?!).\n\nJust go, it's delicious. Give them your money."
3,"Trader Joe's is really a good place to shop - they have great produce, meat/poultry/fish, cheese, dairy, flowers, dry goods and their prepared products are usually very good and interesting/flavorful.  Wine/beer/liquor/cider selection is also very good.\n\nTheir retailing approach also generally keeps prices reasonable, although some things can be a bit pricey (but the quality is commesurate).\n\nService is very friendly as well, and they always have a treat for my child when finding Koko the monkey.  Return policy is very good as well if you get something that isn't quite right.\n\nI particularly like this location, as having Trader Joe's here (and this is similar in other locations) means more walk in traffic to the other businesses in what generally are strip malls that are older and need some redevelopment."
0,"At first I though the place was ok, not especially tasty or anything, but good enough if in need of some calories. But after further reflection, and after burping fried chicken burps for about 4 hours after eating, I've decided that big in japan isn't worth the trip at all. The food court seating is somewhat lame as well."
3,"This place is a diamond in the rough. The neighborhood, not so good. The building, run down and dodgy. The Food, fantastic and delicious. The service, absolutely welcoming (this may be in part to the owners knowing my GF and her family).\n\nWe ended up getting 3 dishes and I wish I could tell you what they were. However, I didn't order and everyone was speaking Cantonese so... We ended up getting a short-rib dish, a fried noodle dish and a beef and rice noodle dish.\n\nThe short ribs were alright, they had a tasty, albeit very strong 5 spice seasoning to them and were a bit on the chewy side but the flavor was good.\n\nThe Fried Noodle dish was very tasty. The noodles were fried separately from the rest of the dish so they retained a crunchiness while eating them, the bok choy and gravy were very complementary of the various meats in the dish.\n\nThe spicy beef and rice noodle dish was ordered with some random greens added. I think they just threw in whatever was fresh. Either way, my brother and GF said they like that the best. The gravy was good and the beef was tasty. My favourite part was the choy sum, crunchy and delicious.\n\nThe place was pretty full when we walked in and got pretty loud with the other two large groups. Once one of the groups left the noise level decreased exponentially and the owner came out and started chatting it up with everyone still dining.\n\nAs stated in other reviews, there are many non-menu items/specials posted to the walls but they are all in Chinese so I will just leave that stuff to question (though they might be fun to try one day)."
4,"We had dinner in this restaurant . Everything was awesome! Customer service, food, life music and good Italian vine.I suggest you reserve table before coming. Very nice place!"
3,What a great shop! They did repairs on my 95 Honda Accord and tinted a widow! Great customer service and will be back! I was referred by a coworker to AZM and let me tell you what a great feeling it is to find a great local shop!   Yep Im a fan!
3,The place is great. Very quick service.Wiil defentlycome back
1,"I'm new to the area, and on my way home from the coffee shop, I decided to stop on in. After all, I needed a new collar for my pup. \n\nI was greeted right away. Aggressively greeted, but greeted none the less. The gentleman who helped, was clearly the store manager and me spared no enthusiasm, and even up sold me to buying a new tag for the dog, too. I didn't need it, but no harm in a new shiny tag for my babe. \n\nThere was a quiet but seemingly sweet young lady behind the counter performing some kind of pet store task, and being interrupted every 35 seconds... By the gentleman who sold me on my choices and was supposed to be ringing me up. He stopped my transaction more than three times to ask her to say hello to customers who were already AGGRESSIVELY greeted by him! It took so long to just pay for the collar and tag, due to the over greeting and micro managing. I was so exhausted when I left, I said to my friend \""Remind me never to go there again\""\n\nGreat concept. But the guy running the place is just too much. I won't go back to see how grooming services are. Not if I have to deal with that guy, anyway."
4,"I love coming here! My sandwich is always perfect, the soup is flavorful and I love getting free chocolate covered strawberries and bread. The line moves very quick and they are well staffed. Definitely a must try!"
0,"This place is tiny. We were so excited to sing karaoke. Then we found out it would be 1 1/2 hours, before it would be our turn! And there weren't many people there. What a dissapointment."
0,"I recall when the first location opened on Craig rd., it was great and this became home for dinner, lunch and sometimes in the morning after a graveyard shift. Now the staff on Craig Rd acts like they do not want to be there and can be rude at times. It's not just me but I hear this around the area from others. I have since moved near the Centennial location and had the same experience. During my first visits I loved the place, staff and people were great. Now that management has changed a couple of times the place has gone downhill. I can really tell the difference since Bobbi was the manager here and now. Staff is slow and appears to be there just to collect a pay check; no one has a welcoming attitude. Yes they greet you when come in but it feels like they are greeting because that is the rule. My first sign of the decline was when I waited 40 minutes for an order of wings from the bar. I showed a manager the time stamp on my order receipt and all I got was a, \""oh okay,  I'm sorry\"" and he walked away. As of this past Thursday (July 9, 20130) I have decided to stop coming here. I ordered six wings, spinach dip, two beers and two scotches. I noticed on the other side of the bar a customer complaining to the manager and the bar tender making a drink near me with an attitude saying, \""whatever\"" and other employees coming in the bar area trying to see what was going on. That was really nothing compared to a couple of hours after I got home. My stomach was cramping all night and the next morning and I was running to take a crap every hour or two through the night. That was the last straw; a place I once loved has gone completely downhill. Now I understand why PT's down the street has all of the business."
2,"I've been twice and I like it but I haven't been amped enough to give it 4 stars quite yet. It takes some instruction the first time you go...you order off a tablet. It's not cosmic but can be a little cumbersome and time consuming. However, if you are the type to order a specific item then change everything on it and put half of it on-the-side then you will love it. Most annoying to my wife is that when you order a drink, you don't get that drink until your food comes (we always go harass them before that though). \n\nThe food is good and ingredients are fresh. I got a breakfast sandwich and it was a good price at $5. Then I got the Mediterranean Turkey and it was $9, plus $1 since I wanted cheese :(     Not heinous but a slightly expensive sandwich.\n\nNice worker bees. They don't really do a whole lot besides deliver your food so I'm not a huge tipper here. Too bad for them."
3,"Hmm, I can't say too much about this place because I came in a bit tipsy ;P\nOther than the good atmosphere and good seating area, this place is great for watching the games.\nI've tried a sip of black velvet from a friend, and I must say, it's the best I've tried by far..."
3,"We'd also like to rant about how great Pepe's is. From our first visit, hungover after a night of Dbacks and Amsterdam, when I introduced Jenny to menudo (girl is from Arizona and had never menudo'd as a hangover remedy, can you believe it?) to yesterday, our first visit since going vegetarian, Pepe's is consistent. Prices, food, and service are all good and that's all anyone should be asking for in the Avenues."
4,"My husband and I frequently come here while we lived in the area. We love this place! The quality of the food and the service is awesome!  I don't mind the price, I rather spend the money on fresh REAL food than throwing my money away to a sub par establishment. The staff is so awesome! We will miss this place! Keep up the good work everyone!"
0,"Weak donuts!  My 13 yr old son only took a few bites of his apple fritter before saying \""this is gross\"" & discarding it.  I got the donut holes & they were average at best.  Wouldn't go back, even for a free dozen."
4,"Ihave been bringing my cat Squishee here for a year or two now and I have to say, I am always impressed with Dr. Grossman's knowledge and his mild, calm demeanor when handling my Squishee kitty! Squishee is 16 years old and the staff always make a big to do about his arrival and treat him so good! \n\nI am getting ready to take my other ca, much younger, named Basil to him for his first annual with Dr. Grossman. I definitely trust this clinic's opinions and values when it comes to my pet's well being. 5 STARS!!!"
4,"Damn do I love me some Smiling Moose. I have been coming here since it was way more divey and still had holes in the walls (way back before those walls were red, and way back before food was served.) I like everything about this place. I like the upstairs venue for shows. I like the big screen in the back and the random whatever that's on it. I like the drinks named after movies, particularly the Captain Spaulding, and I actually do enjoy the apathy of the staff. I like to drink and be left alone with other heavily tattooed people that like to drink and be left alone. Occasionally, we feel like being social creatures, and when we do, we come to the moose. I have always felt welcome here, and my non-tattooey friends have never felt unwelcome, and that's the most important part. This place gets a rep for only serving a certain kind of people and nothing could be further from the truth. Every bar has it's niche, and some don't seem too welcoming to those who don't fit the profile, that's not the case here. The bartenders aren't going to kiss your @$$, and that's just fine because that's not what I'm looking for. They are going to make you some killer (moderate pun intended) drinks and they are going to laugh at your drunk stupid self. I love this place.\n\nOh yeah...the food is actually pretty awesome."
4,"The carrot raisin muffins alone are deserving of the 5 stars.  This trip the hubby had the chicken pot pie and I had the Quiche Lorraine.  Pot pie was flaky and comforting.  Quiche was fluffy and not dense, just the way I like it.  The food is always good here.  I also had an iced coffee and it was perfect.  Service is 10x better here than the Mimi's Cafe on Sahara.  I took my cousin to the Mimi's on Sahara about a month ago and the waiter acted like he had never heard of an \""iced coffee\"".  My cousin had to literally tell him to give her a coffee with ice."
0,"Spoke to a nice lady on the phone. Drove halfway across town to purchase a bike. When I got there, the lady wasnt there, instead it was her husband.  She was going to give me 10% off, but the husband would only honor that if I was military or ex-military...a complete waste of my time!  Owner was rude! I would recommend staying away from this place...I just noticed that bikeshops.mtbr.com has similar reviews of this place going back to 2008...those reviews are dead on!"
2,"Being a lazy bum who doesn't want to wash his own truck, and having sworn off Danny's and their army of overly aggressive windshield replacement sales goobs, I took the advice of some Tweeters and rolled into Los Olivos. \n\nThe $15 wash was more than adequate but the real experience value came from what Los Olivos didn't do: They didn't try to upsell me and nobody messed with my seats. Seriously, don't touch the seats. \n\nI would recommend Los Olivos because my vehicle was clean, the people were nice, and they aren't associated with Danny's Carousel in any way. And that's enough."
1,"I like a menu that has limited choices. However, if you're menu is limited then what you make needs to be outstanding. Both of our burgers were dry as were the buns. The egg on my burger was over hard. In all my times of ordering a \""dirty\"" burger, I've never had the egg fried hard. The point of the egg is for the yolk to soak into the bun and run over the meat. The truffle fries were a miss with the sauce tasting more like an Alfredo. We ended up sending them back and asking for plain fries suggesting maybe they were soggy because they sat too long. Server was pleasant and the wine was good. We won't return."
2,"Don't get me wrong this place is very fancy. I like that they play new and old movies.\n\nYou go to the cashier and you pay for a your ticket and you also get a huge menu for food and drinks. As you continue to walk into the movie theater you will see a huge bar. No one was sitting there, but if you wanted to get wasted before a movie this is your place to go. \n\nYou'll see waiters and waitress walking all around and you find your theater. You walk in and there are rows with huge comfy chairs with a side table that you can put in front of you if you get food or drinks. Don't get me wrong  you definitely get a lot of leg room! However there is one row that is just a row of computer chairs up to a bar table. No one was sitting in front of me, but I can imagine if it was a tall guy/girl I wouldn't have been able to see the screen too well.\n\nWith the Groupon that I got it came with a free drink so I got a strawberry lemonade, It'd order it again. Beside the Groupon we ordered a popcorn which was also good. I know they had a lot of other stuff like chicken and pizza and stuff, but I wasn't there to eat dinner. \n\nYou have servers walking all around through the movie and you just push this little red button if you want something. But you do have to hear talking through the movie if someone decides to order then. \n\nI also must say it was very cold in there! So if you want to get away from the Arizona heat, this is the place for you."
0,This was the first time that we have eaten at Babbo and we opted for take-out. No complaints about the staff they were all nice...but oh my goodness...the food...one word sums it up...blech. We both ordered the chicken marinara sandwiches which we later found out were no longer on the menu at this location...and we decided to split an order of spaghetti and marinara. I asked for some extra marinara sauce for my sandwich...I asked for it on the side as in a small container...it was on my sandwich and it made it too messy to pick up. My first bite nearly made me fall off my chair...the focaccia bread was so salty that the roof of my mouth was burning...and each subsequent bite was the same...I tried scraping it off the bottom but it was too far baked into the bread to do that. Now everyone who knows me knows that I salt salt...that is not a typo...salt is a food group for me...they really over did this spice. The chicken was tough and tasteless. The spaghetti with marinara sauce actually needed some salt...or some taste...it too was awful. We do take-out four or five nights a week and the food is always fine..we never have any complaints no matter what we order...I am watching my husband tidy up and there is a ton of food left...he asked what I wanted him to do with it and I said throw it all out...he normally eats the leftovers but he doesn't want any of it. I have a stomach ache from all of the salt and my mouth still feels weird from it. Why so much salt on bread? I have a heart condition and high blood pressure. I think if people want salt it should be their choice to add it...this was our first and our last visit to Babbo. My husband is more tolerant than I am about bad food...I told him he could probably save all of the chicken that I didn't eat and put it on a sub roll for lunch tomorrow...he said no thanks...and he just remarked that it was about as disappointing a meal as you can get. Wish I could give it a bunch of minus stars. Blech. blech...blech!
2,"Good value, pretty good food.  I give Sultan's props for serving middle eastern in a culinarily lacking location.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The food was relatively good - especially considering the price - $6.99 for lunch special which ends up at $7.50 with tax.  The restaurant smelled a little bit like public restroom (the cleaner) which was kind of a turn off."
3,"Nice Indian place hidden atop hill on Greentree. Food was good as expected of a good Indian restaurant. Had the Chicken Sangrilla, Lamb Korma, and Kheema Naan ...all were great."
4,I got to open a bottle of Champagne with a sword!
3,"I go out of my way to find a Fry's. Great customer service, excellent quality in food, great prices, clean stores & fuel points. I buy my gift cards for work and what ever I want to spend money on then turn around and get the discount at the pump. Good call! you'll always find me shopping at Fry's"
1,"We have been eating around a little now that we are retired and have time to experience new places for lunch. We arrived just before noon and there was some activity and all the TVs pumping all sorts of yesterdays games or today's sport news.Being the grump I am I asked if one of the 30 or so TVs could be turned to CNBC business news as I like keeping up on my other game.It never happened. \nI asked what of three sandwiches would be best today, Philly, Reuben, or french dip. It was suggested that the Reuben. Only half good. The meat was bland as it was held in a water bath to keep warm and its texture was weak. The bread was so so and french fries average. I won't be back. Service was average but had like 4 different peeps at the table.which I don't\n care for. I like dealing with one server."
1,"Just a bad night. Maybe but, bad service and food is unforgivable when paying big dollars. Nothing more to say."
4,"Came here to just try it out, but then their food just blew me away! The service is way better then Roberto's the workers actually serve with a smile! The drive through is really convenient. Awesome experience overall and I would defiantly come back again!"
0,Waiter served me a cold meal left over from a party being held there.  Absolutely horrible experience.
1,Another new name but the same overpriced stuff. The theater is getting more and more run-down looking. Maybe the new owners will spruce it up? I hope so--the building isn't very old...\n\nBut expect more of the same so far with Carmike Cinemas as we have experienced with Digiplex and Ultrastar before it.
3,"Stayed at the Palazzo for a crazy Halloween weekend in Vegas. \n\nWith almost no deals that weekend, being that the Cigar Convention AND that is was Halloween, we were going to pay a pretty penny anywhere we went. At least at the Venetian and Palazzo, you get a little suite with your room. \n\nI've stayed at the Venetian, and the Palazzo definitely feels like a mini upgrade. The building is newer, the rooms are modern-chic, and the room had a total of three tvs. One in the bathroom! \n\nI got to shower, while watching the Rocky Horror Picture Show, on Halloween. You can't beat that!!\n\nRoom service was fast and pretty affordable. The beds were very comfy, and the couch could have held 2 extra party crashers on it. The parking was confusing at first, but after one time, it's easy."
1,"We had a great team event (getting to know other team members) here but not much can be said abt the food. I had the ahi tuna with cold soba noodles, the soba wasn't bad but the tuna had some funky taste to it. The sauce did not go well and it was just undesirable. I left half of it behind. First time that I did not fish ahi tuna! We had a big group for dinner, abt 20 but the entire restaurant was empty but it took ages before we received the food. They were certainly not understaffed since there were at least 20 servers running around but no idea why. \n\nI'm sorry but two star is being generous; 1 for the great group camaderie and networking event we had and 2 for the somewhat nice interior decor."
0,"Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited, but hell, it was going to be free! \nGot to the restaurant around 4:45 for an early dinner. Walked in, there were about 5 parties sitting in a very full waiting room. No employee visible, the hostess stand deserted. The only employee I could see in the entire restaurant was the bartender!\nAfter waiting for about 5, a girl came up, and asked how many in our party. I responded \""two of us, but is there a wait??\"" She responds, \""yes at least 10-15 minutes\"".\nAt this point I look around the restaurant, way more empty tables then full. Like David K stated, I understand the shifts and seating requirements in a restaurant, but customer service and perception is always #1. \n\nNeedless to say, I walked out before we were seated, fearing what could come of this experience. From the other reviews it seems I didn't miss anything. Seems it all boils down to poor management. It is not the employees fault if the manager has no clue how to run a business."
3,Better thank Subway by a mile. However it's just a sandwich. A good sandwich though. If you are in the mood for a cold cut sandwich you can't go wrong here. The bread is fresh and the quality of the meets and cheeses are better than most other sandwich shops. When I'm in the mood for a sandwich POS is usually my 1st choice.
1,"Have had some good experiences at Buffalo Wild Wings in the past but can't really recommend this place anymore due to my last experience here.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nCame on a Thursday night to watch a football game.     Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\n\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\n\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\n\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\n\n\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\n\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \""get it whenever we're ready\"", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \n\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \n\n\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \n\n\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \n\n\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.     No thanks."
2,"Food was very average...Entree selection was not impressive, deserts were very good.   Ambience was low key-boring....... \n\nNot bad for the price, but not memorable..."
1,"I love total wine...just not this one.\n\nI shop for beer and occasionally shop for wine. I'm not sure if the stocking is broken up into sections by type of alcohol (spirits, wine, beer) but whoever orders the beer does a horrible job. I can always count on this Total Wine to NEVER have what I'm looking for. The shelves are almost always half full with gaps everywhere and signs saying it's out of stock. If I want a good selection, I drive to the one of Shea.\n\nFIRE the person who orders the beer! North Scottsdale can get it right, you should be able to as well."
3,"This is really cool place and the service is AMAZING! We had a great time and the ambiance was just perfect. A mixture of contemporary flair with interesting decor. I do want to share some details about my experience. Visited for dinner. 10/3/2012\n\nService: Simply amazing. The waitresses were all smiles and very accommodating. I had several requests for my dish and they got them perfect. Both waitresses were always checking in on us and I thought it was great how they supported each other.  Nothing fell through the cracks!\n\nAmbiance. Casual and hip, yet romantic. Lots of energy in the place and you could see others were enjoying their conversations sitting around their rustic wooden tables and eating great food. \n\nFood (appetizers). The mussels oreganata are out of this world. I truly believe you would be hard pressed to find a more flavorful dish anywhere in town. The textures and flavors in this dish are very unique...you will love them. The sweet chili and bacon prawns were great but a little too sweet and spicy for my taste.\n\nFood (entrees). I was really excited for my beef wellington but unfortunately it was average. The pastry around it was thick and the sauce tasted like it came out of an instant gravy packet :(  The scampi stuffed chicken pasta was very good and the balsamic vodka sauce was incredibly flavorful.\n\nPrice. For a casual dinner for two, $150 was a tad expensive for my taste. Do not get me wrong, the food is great but I do not think charging around the same amount as some of the high end restaurants on the strip entices customers to visit as often as they like. It their prices were a bit less expensive, I would definitely visit quite often. \n\nOverall experience. Great restaurant and I would recommend it to friends and family. Having said that, I would try other stuff on the entree menu and would most certainly NOT recommend the Wellington."
0,Decent food.  Comparable to Panera Bread.  Terrible service. Extremely expensive ($40 for three sandwiches and three drinks).  Unkind staff.  Impolite.
2,"I love supporting small local businesses, especially if it's Hawaii based/influenced. \nI met a few friends here for lunch and everything was good. The location, service and food was all good but nothing special. I ordered combo plate with pork and 2 pc shrimp katsu that included miso soup, 2 pc daikon and rice (rice was mushy) and I paid for a small side of curry and it all came out to $20.(If I didn't order the curry it would have been around $18).\nPlease don't get me wrong....the food here was good just not worth the price. You can get chicken katsu that also includes miso soup, cucumber sunomono and salad for $8.50 at Soho down the street!! \n\nI say come here and eat to support locals from hawaii. But if you don't want to overpay then just go to \n1. Soho down the street and order Chicken Katsu (lunch menu only).\n2. Curry Zen (spring mtn)\n3. L&L Hawaiian BBQ :)"
4,"Beautiful place. the inside was stunning! Didn't eat here just had some drinks, the tequila selection is nice and the staff is great. Definitely will come back to eat!"
3,"Another gem off the beaten path. It's in the Wal - Mart plaza. \n\nThe BBQ is actually a fusion of Hawaiian, Korean and Japanese.\n\nEverything I tried so far is pretty good and believe me I tried alot last time. Next time I think I'm just gonna go with the AYCE for 13 bucks. \n\nThis is mom and pop shop, never really seen it busy but thats probably because not many people know about it. \n\nThe Chicken Katsu was pretty good and the Bul-go-gi kinda tatse like the fake beef from yoshinoya in a GOOD way. You know you love the meat from there even if you are unsure if it's real meat sometimes. \n\nWorth checking it out."
3,"Also known as the Penalty Box. Best place to go if you want to be full and hammered for approximately $10. It's more than a dive bar! Food and drink specials every night. My favorite specials are the hamburger, tacos at $0.25 a piece, and pirogues at 15 cents a piece. Aside from the food they have a variety of cheap and craft beer, well below even the Pittsburgh drink average. Bartenders are super nice and let you have the remote to the tv. I used to watch a lot of law and order SVU here. \nEvery once in a while someone will be drunk and accidentally take your drink or offer you some coke.. Other than that his place has gotten me through so many rough times and I am grateful for its existence! I hope it never closes or changes. A true gem!"
0,"So these guys were meant to finish putting my tires on in 45 minutes, yeah? Thus my hiatus to Culver's, yeah? Hoping that on my return in 45 minutes, my car would have two brand new 255/95R18's on as they quoted, yeah? It didn't quite happen that way! \n     I strolled back from Culver's ready to drive off....but the numbers on my invoice were not the ones I paid for... they put on some tires that cost 90 bucks each, when I paid for 280 each for two!  Not sure why they did this....were they hoping that I would drive off not realizing since I'm female? ? ?"
3,"I'm pretty easy when it comes to buffets.  I only have a few requirements:  (1) a clean dining room, (2) fresh and tasty crab legs and fried chicken and (3) mind-blowingly good sweet treats.  Carnival World Buffet satisfies all three with added extras like a great dim sum and fried food section.  Loved the fried food: fried clam strips, fried shrimp, fried scallops and onion rings!! Crab legs were juicy and tasty and the fried chicken wings were great.\n\nAnd I couldn't help but come back to get more sweet treats like their mint chocolate chip gelato with warm chocolate bread pudding and their bananas foster.  \n\nHighly recommended."
2,"Munchies is okay, but it doesn't hold a candle to Yogurtland, IMHO.  On my last visit I couldn't find a flavor that I liked.  Vanilla tasted the best of all of them, and that never happens!  A lot of the flavors taste very artificial.  The friends I go there with, though, always pick up a couple of pre-packed quarts to take home, so I guess I'm in the minority.  I'm not a toppings person, except for an occasional little squirt of fudge, so I can't judge or compare those.\n\nBut Menchies is much closer to my house, and I love that they support the community, so I will continue to patronize them."
4,"We enjoy coming here for all of our ASU, Yankees, and Raiders needs. Owners are great people and Raiders fans!"
0,"RIP-OFF ALERT!!!!! Went for a little school clothes shopping - prices are way out of whack - jeans with holes for $18, faded out t-shirts for $2, AND THEN... went to pay for 5 magazines. A sign by the books clearly states: \""Magazines 29 cents\"", only @ the checkout they were marked on the back 99 cents!!! Talked to manager who just said that's their system. Won't be going back. Honesty is NOT company policy."
0,"Went on a late Tuesday afternoon. I can't imagine what this place looks like on a weekend.\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to make one side for small dogs, and the other for larger dogs? If there was a scuffle, it wouldn't be a possible death sentence? Or if the larger dogs do run a little bit, my dog wouldn't get trampled and possibly break its leg? That is my one major complaint.  If you are on the passive side, why would you bring a ball and thrower, and have a 150 pound dog. That worries me a little and doesn't really suggest a passive dog. One bad jump, or one bite, and my dog is dead or seriously injured. \n\nAlso, why are the people so.... rude and unwelcoming? I felt like I was in grade school getting picked last for kickball. No, i am not from Scottsdale. I didn't bring Poopsie or a gigantic shiz wagon that drags me along by it's leash. I'm the new girl...oooooh.\nI literally had one lady come up to me, stare, then say \""Are those dogs with you?\"" I say yes, she stares some more and then walks away. ???\nI just stood there feeling like an a-hole.\nIf I seen some girl come walking in with cute little dogs I would at least come up and BE FRIENDLY.\n\nYes it's large and somewhat clean, especially considering the sheer numbers of dogs there (some 4 to 1 person).  If you like crowds, then this is for you. I'm just not into being treated like a leper. Being around 25 dogs, and 12 snotty people that don't pay attention and use it as their social hour. The only thing this place is missing is a martini bar."
1,"Went in this Wed night to get away from the housemates. Was not in the most upbeat manner. Found the place boring. Football on all screens jukebox cut off. Bunch of old guys mostly. The rest were mostly fat couples getting wasted and guys with to much sideburns.\nThen a couple of brothers (black men) also old walked in wearing their throw back Shaft leather jackets. Totally weird crowd!\n\nThe bartender was a slim young woman that needs to go to bartending school. I watched her attempt to make cocktails with more than 2 ingredients. What a disaster! She over pours and under pours and added some ingredients like whiskey to what was suppose to be a long island!   Pours the largest straigt shoots I have ever seen and I tell you I have been to bars like in MT, WY, AK and New Orleans and not seen anything close to this size of a shoot!\n\nConsulted with some off duty guy on how to make 6 Kamikazes (ended up being 5 and she had to make another that end up being 2.5 drinks instead of 1) and together with a book they came up with a cranberry version because, get this they have no lime juice! What sorta bar in the SW opens its doors without LIMES or LIME JUICE?  The guy kept calling the drink Cosmos and I kept repeating I know the difference and the order was KAMIKAZES.  Then he brings me the book and is still pointing out Cosmos!  I verbally give the bartender the recipe for Kamikazes plus the variation for a blue one. Guy says you must make a lot of drinks! I say you want to hire me - I've got experience?\n\nI tell you if they want to keep the doors open they better get some help with bar and budget knowledge. The budget is being shoot by over pours and wrong pours and if the liquor control sees this they're certian to be busted/fined. Hey but the bartender knows how to wash glasses well so that was a relief to see.\n\nAnd it's true that drinks are about $4 though the sign says $5! LOL\nWhat an experience. I left confident in my bartending skills though I haven't poured in a month!"
0,The hostesses didn't say a word to me until I had been staring at them and tapping my foot for seven minutes while they talked with each other. Later on getting the check and then processing it each took ages. It wasn't even a full section. The food was okay...
3,"I was really worried about going on any vacation without the dogs and didn't think it was possible!\n\n I didn't want to burden family and friends. Also, I'm \""that person\""- that stresses what my dogs eat  and most of our friends \""free feed\"" commercial crap or have stuff out that may be an issue with our dogs (like kids leaving cheetos out, kids toys, pens, stuffed toys, etc) and they not realize it until it's torn to bits.\n\nOn the other hand, I am really apprehensive about leaving them to some strangers. Everyone has that nightmare thought of what if a place will neglect them and just care about the money?  \n\nAfter so much hub bub of researching and asking around, I decided to pop in with my dogs to see how they would react to the people and the place. They seemed fine so we booked out trip. \n\nThey give you a webcam address that you can access on your computer or there is a phone app to access their feed. Mind you the cameras are still and do not show the whole room so sometimes your dog may be on the fringes like mine were. Unfortunately those two were mostly on the fringes so I had to check often to even see where they are and would get a few moments of seeing them run onto screen and run back out of range. Still nice to see them and general monitor the facility. I saw people come in and sit on the couches and pet all the dogs so it was nice to see they were friendly to the dogs and the dogs were happy to see them whenever they were there. \n\nThey seem okay when we got them, but passed out as soon as we got home. Figured, even though they slept and all there it wasn't the relaxed sleep they get being next to me. \n\nI had a groupon to use with a bath and brush grooming so I asked if I can have their nails trimmed too while they get groomed. Theirs was very long and I get nervous about trying to cut my girl down short with her black nails. They didn't take much off, just the tips so it didn't feel like it was worth $8 each when at the vets they cut it down to be short.  \n\nI got their food bags back and only half their food has been used. Remember how I said I was really freakish about their food diet? Well, I measured out portions for all the days plus one extra days worth incase. They put it in a bag so I didn't see until I got home or I might have asked about it. I don't know if they weren't eating because they're nervous or that 1 cup meals was misunderstood between both and not each since I just made a big bag with both their names on it and measurement directions. \n\nWhen we picked them up, all the feedback we got from the lady was they \""did great and were fine\"". If they weren't eating then I don't think so and I should have been told as it can be useful to know in case I board them again. More details than that would have been nice since I've never boarded them there, never left them with anyone EVER. \n\nI think overall this place is decent though. I like that the camera feed is given and the access is 24/7 (some shut it after the place closes for the night). The price is just right and great value for multiples. Many places only charge PER DOG and here there are multiple dog prices. I boarded two for $45 (average in other places is $30-$40 per dog). My dogs seem to not be unhappy being there and approached staff on camera so they had to be treated well. One of my dogs is skittish and if she was not treated well by someone, she will usually space herself from that person. \n\nI will be using them again for boarding as I at least feel comfortable knowing that my dogs are okay with this place and the staff."
2,"I'm generally not a fan of waiting in line at clubs (ok, really, I'm not a fan of waiting anywhere. My natural enemy is the line.) but our group was playing things by ear that night and it landed us at Jet. We waited for about 45 minutes or so to get in but I have to say that the line was very well organized and the bouncers were very nice and tried to keep everyone in a good mood. If you are in a group of girls, of course, you can get in much faster. But being that we are nice girls we decided not to ditch our husbands (we are, after all, legally obligated to them once the trip is over) and to wait it out with them. \n\nI had always avoided going to Jet and I could never figure out why. Now having gone there I know. Its just a club. It could be anywhere. There is nothing particularly special about it in any way. I would not get bottle service here, I don't think its necessary at all. There was never a long line for the bar, and it never got to the point where it was so crowded you couldn't move. For the money that you would spend on bottle service here I would suggest you go to Tao or Tryst instead. \n\nThe music in the main room was ok, they did keep switching between pop and classic rock which tends to annoy me as I find it hard to dance to songs like Sweet Home Alabama. I enjoyed the back room where they were playing old school hip hop much, much, more and if I should ever return to Jet I would stay in that room and that room only. However, I'm not sure that I would return as I think Jet is nothing special."
1,"Note to self - yelp has a mobile app, use it!\nI wish I would have read the reviews for this place before stopping in for lunch but I was in the area and figured a chain couldn't be bad. Ha!\n\nA sign told us to seat ourselves so we did. A server stopped by and asked if we wanted something to drink. We all ordered but I almost had to argue with the server to get a root beer. She told me it was from the tap and was $4.50; she said this like she was trying to talk me out of it but she did add that I would get free refills. Ha! More on this later. She didn't give us menus and left for about five minutes. When she returned she brought menus but forgot the straws so she disappeared again. I should note that there were three servers for six occupied tables.\n\nWe finally got to order. I had the parmesan chicken sandwich. It was pretty bland. I got potato salad for a side, also bland. I tried the Philly Cheesesteak and, yep - bland. I also tried the fries. They were OK.\n\nThe server never did stop by to see if everything was OK or to refill our drinks. I waited patiently for my check and finally got up and hunted her down. She was chatting with the other servers. I got my check, paid cash so I wouldn't have to spend any more time and left. On the way out I noticed a sign that said we were entitled to a free dessert. Someone might want to mention it to the server.\n\nOverall, bland food, terrible service and an expensive root beer."
4,"My son has been going here for about 5 months. It's his first time in child care. He loves it here. The teachers are remarkable. He is learning sooo much! The school is extremely clean. The teachers are very organized and there are no behavior problems or issues with the children. Even when my son goes to kindergarten next year, I will definately make sure he gets to spend time with Ms. Chrystal and the rest of her staff."
4,One of the best if not the best ever Bone In Rib Eye Ive ever had. There wasnt a bad bite of that steak. It was cooked to perfection. Great stop on the book tour to a some what hidden away gem upstairs in Planet Hollywood.
4,"Rooms were nice and spacious, very clean, across the street is a 24 hour walgreens so if you need anything you can get it at anytime. A lot of beggers in this area around the streets and on the bridges though."
2,At least the prices are good because the parking sucks & employees aren't very helpful.
0,"My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a birthday present.\nWe both went today and both left feeling like we were better off before we went in.\n\nMy sister made the appointment a month ago and it was for a facial, massage and pedicure.  We were expecting a call to confirm the appointment yesterday but no one had called, hmmm, not very professional...\nWe went in and the majority of the \""spa\"" is a hair salon, I'm not too fond of hair salons calling themselves a \""spa\"" just because they have a couple of massage and facial rooms, but whatever, we'll see how the staff is...\n\nWe both got massages first and I got the blind lady, Evon.  I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.\n\nSo there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.\n\nJulie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.\n\nI like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  \nGotta cater to the customers so they will come back."
2,"Just stopped in for second time this week. Ordering process went quicker. No snafus at checkout. Only had to wait a few minutes for fresh okra which they fry on order.  People before and after me had some errors in orders or  missing sides.  I did hear a lot of \""I'm sorry about that\""  but altogether seemed to go better. \n\nOrdered the 3-meat plate this time with Mac and cheese and okra.  The okra rocked! . The meat plate not so much.  Hard to decipher which was the brisket and which was pork. In my pic the upper left is the pile of fat I had to pick out before even tasting.   I may give them one more shot and that's it."
1,"Don't get me wrong... I LOVE Senor Frogs. In Mexico, but not here.. The fun was great, the dancing and the view off the patio was great. Service was okay, but took a while to get our check. The prices were outrageous, and the free \""shots\"" were only mixers with no alcohol. The Yard is priced at $24 BUT it's almost the same size as the $10 drink which the only difference is you get to keep the cup. Would I go there again? Probably not, the only thing I would do is go there to watch the Sirens show when its going on from the patio. I was sadly disappointed as it was my 30th birthday. And I have to say that both the Senor's I been to in Mexico (Mazatlan) and Ensenada and this was nothing close to either one of those...  I did not have any food, so I can't review that. Save yourself the cash and go somewhere else... And I have to add the drinks were just okay. My friend got one drink that tasted like it had too much syrup in it."
2,"A group of us stayed at the Palazzo for a trade show and saw these awesome pictures of burgers from this place.  After being at a trade show for 3 days, I was hankering for some white rice.  They have Loco Moco!! YAY!  The Poutine fries, Garbage fries, and fried Mac and Cheese were gooood.  The fried mac and cheese are these bits of fried squares of creamy goodness.  Also had the fried pickles.  Wasn't to excited about these.  They sliced the pickles lengthwise and the batter was greasy and not much flavor.  My co-workers like their burgers.  There were 6 of us so I don't remember what they ordered.  I got the Loco Moco and was disappointed.  I ordered it medium rare.  The burger was cooked on too high of heat too fast cause the edges were hard and dry and only a tiny piece was medium rare.  The rice... there bunch of crunchy pieces... yah.... hard rice... not good....  My coworker had the red velvet cheese cake.  There was the crust,  then there is a layer of red velvet cake and then cheese cake on top.  He really liked it.  I got the banana fosters cheese cake.  Is it worth the calories?  Only if there wasn't an ice cream place around. \n\n1 star for the fried mac and cheese\n1 star for the server who was quick and efficient (he knew we had to catch a flight)\n1 star for the Poutine and Garbage fries"
3,"We ate here with some of my boyfriend's hometown friends. The food  was pretty decent, all fresh-tasting Italian. The vodka pasta the other couple mostly split was well-seasoned and wonderful, but not really worth the price tag. The steak with warmed tomatoes, one of the veal dishes, and a broccolini/sweet sausage pasta dish rounded out the meal...all very good dishes, but nothing outstanding or really that memorable. I love Italian food and pasta, but Rao's was a tad overpriced. The portions were large, but the 4 of us opted to share everything \""family-style,\"" to taste more dishes...which I also HIGHLY reccomend. I think if we had all picked one dish, we either would have been bored, disappointed, or spent too much and had too much left over to order courses. \n\nThe waiter was extremely knowledgable about the food, restaurant, chef, wine, etc....but he was sort of obnoxious and in our faces and too much....It was also a little strange to me how much information he went on about...at a nicer place like that, to just assume all of the diners were idiots with an utter lack of food knowledge was a little strange. The waiter often explained dishes and items to us, like describing the different levels of doneness for steak, explaining that broccolini is bitter, etc...I think maybe a different table of people might have loved his comments better, but oh well. All in all this place was just ok, not somewhere I'd bring friends in town to, but I would absolutely eat here meeting people."
0,"Dreadful!  Went there Saturday night with a Travelzoo coupon that apparently identified us as unwelcome guests.  They sat us at the worst table ever & refused to move us even though we asked them to & there were other tables available.  We were in the middle of traffic & the table was so small that we had to put things on the floor to fit our food. The food was fair, the service was fair & the margaritas were quite tasty but I thought overpriced at $12.  The kicker was when they added an 18% tip for a party of two with no notification. We usually tip a minimum of 20% & found this insulting & a little underhanded.  We are locals & we will not be returning & will not be recommending this place."
3,"After going to Square Cafe twice during peak brunch times, I have resolved to come early in the morning, which is perfect. Nice selection of breakfast items from your sweet to savory and for reasonable prices though I feel like they have changed the menu recently so that there are less items. Anyway I don't get the name of the cafe but there are shapes (not just squares) painted on the ceiling in bold colors with local art work hanging so it is a comfortable atmosphere. \n\nThe service has been good - coffee is always filled (cups that the coffee come in are shaped interestingly cool) and the waitresses check in at reasonable times with a smile on their face. They are there to get you in and out with a full belly due to the volume of customers.\n\nI've eaten quite a few of their scrambles and omlettes along with their home fries and toast. The combinations of the flavors work well and homefries don't need any additional seasoning unless ketchup. Pancakes are fluffy and sweet, love how there is a dallop of whipped butter and whip cream. I have yet to have the french toast but my boyfriend always orders them with strawberries.\n\nThis is a staple breakfast place for us."
1,"So this is a mom and pop place in a not so great neighborhood.  We decided to give it a try since our favorite Korean place closed down and it is close to Nellis Base.  The name implies that they are known for fish and chips?  We didn't try it but maybe we should have.  The place is small ( only 5 tables).  Very amateur decor.  They were friendly enough.  They do make food as you order and only take cash.  We ordered fried wontons, egg rolls, spicy pork bulgogi, and mild beef bulgogi.  The wontons weren't Very flavorful.  The egg rolls were mushy and bland.  The bulgogi was just ok.  Barely.  We have been to Korea and this just wasn't good.  It was $40 for both of us.  A bit high for low quality.  We will continue our search for good Korean food."
0,"Take a minute to brainstorm everything you hate about Walmart.  Every generic , stereotypical thought you can come up with about this corporation.  Go ahead, I'll wait a little longer...\n\nThis Walmart embodies every single one of those stereotypes.  There is nothing good I can say about this place.  Ok, maybe one good thing: the people watching here is top notch.  Especially on a Friday night (or the 1st of the month).\n\nI have been to this Walmart 3 times.  I refuse to ever go again.  It is seriously that bad.  This is no exaggeration.  You have been warned."
1,"Pei Wei, why oh why did you think it would be smart of change your menu and the look of your original concept?  I personally think it was a bad move!  I hate that there are not many of the original items on the menu at this new, remodel.  \n\nI had the BBQ Korean dish which didnt really have much flavor and was kind of bland!  I also miss the separate line there use to be for people who called in or ordered online.  I probably won't be coming back to this location.  If I need to I will find another location that has the old items because those items are what made Pei Wei one of my favorites!"
4,"I had a gold pendant with diamonds made by Alex - simple, unusual and beautifully unique. I love one of a kind pieces and this was superb. I recommend anyone living or visiting to come to his shop in Old Town Scottsdale. Simply exquisite!"
2,"Limited menu, high prices... tasty but not filling. I probably won't go back, but that shouldn't stop you from at least trying it."
1,I guess I really just dont like buffets in this town.  The prime rib was so salty.  I would stay away just pay the extra money and hit the steak house.
2,"It's OK, I'm not going to go out of my way raving about it, but it was definitely better than Strip Burger.  At least this seems like hand pressed beef, where Stip Burger uses the preformed SYSCO patties.  The bar for me is The Great Grille from Burbank, unfortunately they are long closed due to the owner passing.  If you have your choice, go to In-N-Out or Tommys!  $40 for two including shakes, a soda, and twofer or whatever it was.  The basket of fries and rings."
4,We had a great experience here! Wonderful western decor inside and out. This was their 6th Anniversary celebration so they were blowing up tons of balloons. They brought a basket of bread with mini corn muffins and dinner rolls before the meal. My spouse ordered the French Dip and I had the Chicken pizza. His sandwich was served hot and stuffed with meat. He liked the sweet potato fries and marshmallow cinnamon dip. We both had passion tea. My pizza was made fresh and was a true artisan pizza. Very unique. It was our first time in so we were treated to cotton candy (cherry cheesecake flavor) for dessert which is quite a nice and different added touch. The portions are large so we took boxes home. Our server was Steve and he was very attentive. The manager came by and introduced himself. The place wasn't busy but there were people coming and going. Priced at about $20-30 per person depending on what is ordered. We would recommend this place to our friends & look forward to returning. No complaints means 5 stars!
3,"Slightly embarrassed to say I have never been to this place intoxicated and am still giving a 4 star review.  \n\nMy husband (a U of I grad) and I have been here 4 times over the course of the past few years and have never been disappointed aside from the less than sanitary bathrooms midday.  The least exciting menu option (in my humble opinion) is my husband's favorite, that being the hasbrown, sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich.  I try something new everytime, and I even felt compelled to buy a \""What the F\"" shirt.   Word."
4,"Recently went there with some friends for a Sunday brunch, and everything we ate was amazing.  I had the short rib benedict, and was amazed at how tender the beef was.  The bloody mary was spot on, too.\nTheir manager came over to our table to check on us, and spent some time explaining the the other things they have which we didn't order.  I guess they change their menu quite often (but please don't take away the rib benedict!)\nAll in all, a filling, tasty brunch.  Would go back."
4,This place is wonderful! We had a cast party there. The woman refilling our appetizers just overheard my friend ask if there was anything I could eat (because I'm vegetarian) and she immediately said she would bring out some vegetarian appetizers. They did the lettuce wraps and quesadilla vegetarian and they  were delicious and had a vegetarian protein source (cashews in the lettuce wrap).
1,"I'm sad right now. I wanted to like this place so badly. I wanted to have the positive experience others did and be able to happily write about it on yelp. Hubby and I went last weekend; got all dressed up, left the kids at home and took the date car. People watching was great, service was great, even our table location was great. The bar area was great. I loved the atmosphere. Did not mind it being dark at all because it was so cool inside. \nWhat was NOT great? Pretzel bread was a little stale but butter, lots of it, helped. The seafood tower was impressive, but the seafood adorning it was not so much. The Clear Lobster roll was outright INEDIBLE. Mushy, no flavor, disappointing.\nMy mambo salad was passable but nothing great.  When I asked for shrimp on top, after hearing so many great reviews about the shrimp, they gladly obliged. BUT when it came, they were overcooked and rubbery. WAH for me. Husband's steak was very good. He was gloating for sure. \nWe got two sides, the Crab Truffle Gnocchi and the peas. The gnocchi was decent but I really could only have a couple of bites due to the intense richness with nothing to offset it. The peas, while super fresh, were SWIMMING in oil. Seriously, they took great peas and drowned them to death in a sad, sad oil lake. \nThe butter cake was superb. Nothing but fond memories of that. \nSo, we spent a small fortune for a meal with one (for me) or two (for hubby) great points. \nI will not be going back. I will not be recommending. We live in Mesa, and were the first of our circle of influence to go and I am devastated to be the one steering people away due to such a lackluster first showing. \nI wonder what went wrong. So many other yelpers just love this place."
2,"Honey Bear's BBQ has a few great BBQ options. For a Phoenix BBQ joint, it is top of line in quality. I can not say as much for the service or atmosphere.\n\nAs far as basic BBQ menu options go, Honey Bear's is where it is at in Phoenix. I love their pulled pork sandwich and their sauce is fantastic. They have a great variety of sides to go along with it as well. I found their ribs meat to be delicious, however, it was pretty fatty at some parts. I have definitely had better elsewhere in the country.\n\nHoney Bear's would be a four star restaurant with a few steps in the right direction towards improving costumer service and the costumer's dining experience. First, get wait staff the goes around and ask costumers about how they are enjoying their meal and if they could get them anything else to make their meal more enjoyable. Then, remove the ads from the table and reinvest profits into the business.\n\nPro-tip: Watch where you park so your car does not get towed. And be sure to check in on yelp to redeem your offer."
1,"Mike really wanted to go to Yard House, despite bad food experiences the first two times he'd been and the fact that it was 20 miles away. Said Mike, \""Yeah, I keep giving them a chance hoping things will change.\""\n\nChuck, the first waiter, was terrific.  Great personality and just a fun guy.  When we got switched to Molly, however, mmm, not so much.  Not her fault really, but she's no Chuck.   \n\nRick's margarita was terrible and they wouldn't re-make it.  Worst was that they had an attitude about the fact it was a crappy drink. Three of us verified that it sucked. \n\nThe pizza appetizer was just ok, at best, and the Chinese something-or-other was bad as well.  As for the entrees, I had the pan seared scallops.  They were undercooked and the mosh stuff in the middle (oro pasta plus god-knows-what) wasn't very appealing either.  \n\nI absolutely would not recommend this place to any friends and if Eck insists on going back there again, I'll stage a mini-coup and vote him down."
0,"DO NOT GO HERE! Worst customer service EVER! I paid to go thru the car wash TWICE...when I got done..my car had just as many bugs on the front of it along with dirt as though I had not even gone through. Needless to say I was not happy. I asked a manager to come look and he told me that that there was nothing he could do because I didn't buy their expensive wash. I asked if I could at least have one of the paper towels they give out to try and wipe the bugs off. He said 'No', those were for people who bought the $5 wash. I was like really, I just paid $6 and you won't give me one. 'No, nothing I can do to help you.' REALLY?  Guess I'll just use the free vacuums and get washed elsewhere."
0,"Williamson Bikes is probably the worst bike store I have ever done business with (I do a lot of business with bike stores.)  I bought many bike parts and bikes from Williamson way back when they first opened, just off of Williamson Street, Del (the owner) in my opinion is as dishonest as the day is long.  He rips off customers, does dishonest \""repairs\"" and doesn't back up his service.  Glad to see this place close - fewer people will be ripped off by the highly arrogant owner."
4,"I'm giving this five stars for a few different reasons.   We did the turtle feeding experience and were very impressed. We were shown through the facility in the back area and it was very well kept.  Our guide was efficient in explaining the way everything worked and showing us the pumps, tanks, etc. We were able to talk with the aquarists about the different sea life and feeding habits. Watched them feed the sharks as well. Very informative experience. Everyone was super nice.  We even got three free pictures of ourselves feeding the turtles.   As for the aquarium it's self it was very neat. It is small and kind of expensive so look for coupons."
3,"Strip House is undoubtedly good and one of the top steak houses in Vegas, however I just don't know if I'd return.  Everything was cooked very well, our service was on the spot, and the ambiance was posh and comforting, but I just didn't get the WOW factor.\n\nWe go through the motions with our server (tap or bottled) and let him know tap is fine, order two glasses of wine, and were served bread.  All very standard in fine dining restaurants, blah.  Upon the arrival of our wines, we order our first course of either crab cakes or scallops (can't remember) and a caesar salad.  We continue on the order our entrees, a 16 oz. NY Strip and a 10 oz. filet mignon.  We also ordered three sides: whipped potatoes puree, potatoes romanoff, and black truffle creamed spinach.\n\nOur first courses arrived in a timely manner.  The salad was fresh but wasn't the best I've ever had.  And as far as I know with the seafood, it was decent, nothing to rave about.\n\nShortly, after finishing them, our steaks and sides arrive and are cooked near perfectly.  The NY Strip was juicy and flavorful!  And even though my filet was cooked medium (the way I wanted), it was a tad on the dry side with little flavor.  Our sides were very good but perhaps a little on the \""heavy\"" side.  My favorite being the whipped potatoes puree.  The spinach was very rich, creamy, and flavorful.  Though I don't recommend ordering it unless you have at least four people in your party.  The potatoes romanoff was rich as well, with a vast amount of cheddar cheese and sauteed onion.  Again, I wouldn't recommend ordering this unless your are dining with at least a group of four--too much food!\n\nStrip House has a beautiful, luxurious red interior, which is reminiscent of a 1920s red light district.  There are tons of artsy, burlesque'ish pictures of girls hanging from the walls.  For those of you who are dining alone, they do have a nice bar upon entering the restaurant equipped with a large flat screen to watch the games.  Be aware there is music spinning.  However, the music is of a modern retro beat, that is very easy to listen to.  Somehow the music fits the vibe of the restaurant, since most of the clientele is between the ages of 20s-40s.  This is definitely a restaurant to be seen in!  But like I mentioned above, the food just didn't give me the WOW factor."
2,"Surprisingly good food.  I only write \""surprisingly\"" because this place positions itself as a Vegas Style BBQ joint, and as a Las Vegas local of 17 years I know that my town isn't known for its 'cue.\n\nThe food is good with a twist of different.  To date I've sampled their pulled pork, quarter chicken (white), and the Sassy Fries.  It's certainly barbecue-y, but not in a Carolina, Memphis, or KC way... so I suppose it is appropriate to ascribe \""Vegas Style\"" to this place.\n\nTheir meat offerings are tender and well-seasoned, and the fries are mighty good, but the one thing that was a bit off-putting was the consistency of the barbecue sauce.  It was, well, watery and thin.  Good, mind you, but quite runny and transparent.\n\nThe next time I go I'm going to ask if they offer dry versions of their meat.  Unfortunately, however, I fear that wet is the only way they prepare their fare.\n\nPrice-wise, the place is pretty cheap, especially when compared to other BBQ joints I've been to around the nation.  \n\nAt any rate, I'd go back if I needed some BBQ in a pinch and didn't have time to drive several miles to Buzz BBQ on West Craig Rd.  I still prefer the way Memphians get it done in Tennessee, but nevertheless..."
3,"Been coming here since it's opened and I'm still impressed with the consistency and friendly atmosphere.  Our bartender Lori is always smiling and never ceases to amaze me with her knowledge of cocktail concoctions and ability to make them great.  The food always taste well prepared and fresh, never been disappointed."
1,"I heard this place is similar to Chipotle.  Believe it or not we have never been to Chipotle. My wife nd got us both a Rumba Burrito with shreded beef (that was tender but not real flavorful), beans, rice and mango salsa.\n\nIts not the best Mexican food,  that's because it is a fast food type restaurant. It is clean, has large portions, clean tables, decent prices. with plenty of parking. What more can you ask for?\n\nAs stated in another one of my earlier reviews regarding Mexican food. \""I pretty much judge a Mexican restaurant on how their salsa tastes\"". Cafe Rumba's mild red salsa was to my suprise tasty. Their mango salsa was simply awesome. My only complaint was there wasn't enough of either one of them. \n\nFOOD: Super sized and fulfilling. They made sure you did not go home un-satisfied and hungry. PRICE: The prices were good for what you got! SERVICE: Staff was nice, and the service was up to par AMBIENCE: Looks pretty much like a typical fast food restaurant. CONCLUSION: Limited, Straight forward menu. It's not the greatest food / restaurant but definitely not the worst. I'll give them another try for sure."
1,The food was ok.  Waitress forgot my guacamole.  Wait staff continually bumped into our table.  Great wine list.  Nice decor.  I may or may not try again.  Not impressed by the food. Id go up to Narcisse or True Food instead.
4,"My first Michael Mina.\n\nAfter learning that we would have to wait almost 2 hours for craftsteak, my friends and I decided to eat at Michael Mina's Seablue.  I am so glad we did!  It was, quite possibly, one of the best dining experiences of my life.\n\nThe four of us started with an oyster each.  Two of us had Kumamotos and the other two had Raspberry Points.  They were so fresh and delicious!  It was a great beginning for what the rest of the meal would taste like.  The \""bread\"" for the table was actually naan.  It came with a trio of dips - hummus, roasted eggplant, and a creamy cheese.  Our two appetizers were tasting trios.  The steamed trio came with mussles, clams and prawns.  The raw trio came with yellowtail, salmon and tuna.  OMG!  It was so so so good!  We used the naan to sop up the juices produced from our steamed trio.  We ate so much of it that we even asked for more naan, which they brought out with more dip.  Seriously, we knew we were going to hurt from all that food, yet somehow, we couldn't stop ourselves.\n\nBy the time our entrees came out, we were stuffed.  Still, we knew the culinary experience was not one to be passed up so we ate on.  We ordered the Seablue \""paella\"" (it was a tad salty on the bottom), the scallops, and the 16 oz bone-in NY steak.  The food was excellent!  As much as we wanted to finish everything on the table (hey, we knew it was costing a pretty penny), we couldn't stuff our over-stuffed selves.  So, it broke my heart but we left some food on the table because we wanted dessert.  Damn those people who sat next to us, because we probably wouldn't have ordered more food were it not for us seeing their lovely order of desserts.  Being troopers, we rallied each other and ordered what they had - the white chocolate napoleon and the molten chocolate cake.  I've never been a big fan of napoleons but that was the best dessert I've had in a really long time - and I'm a fan of desserts!\n\nOur waiter, bless him, never judged our need to overindulge.  He was professional and efficient and the service was 4 star.  As sometimes happens with fancy places, I am so glad that bad service is not something this place has to worry about.\n\nThis was the best meal I have had this year.\nYay (fellow Marin resident) Michael Mina!!"
0,"The bartender at Geisha was not friendly nor had a smile on her face ever. She became annoyed and hostile with us when having to correct our order. We asked that our edamame could have less salt and her response was \""That's not possible.\"" Not sure where her customer service skills were hidden but I sure hope she finds them in a haste manner.  Wishing her the best of luck since it seems like it will be hunting for a needle in a haystack."
1,"OK so your a noodle place...I did not see one sign of making the noodles or do they.? Had chicken lo mein but did not see the chicken I asked and was told its there.....Oh really   sure it is... And that and a  million dollars and you will win the Lotto.As I tasted the bowl of noodles there was a strong vinegar taste . Not sure if I have ever had Lo mein that had a Vinegar taste  still trying to figure that one out.\n            Maybe pickles got dropped in the noodles?As you can see not many people for lunch but, there was a long line next door at Zaxbys?The King of fast food HUH?"
3,"My boyfriend and I went here for the first time today to get deluxe pedicures! We both have jobs where we are on our feet all day and good pedis are a must for us. The salon is nice and very clean. The staff is friendly but a little forgetful. This place would have gotten five stars but there were a couples of problems. First off make an appt here! They were so busy! My boyfriend and I sat with our feet in the water for an hour before they started our pedis! Sitting and soaking for 20 mins is ideal for me but an hour!? Even I was getting bored and impatient! Second, they were rather overwhelmed and over filled my boyfriends pedi bowl soaking our shoes and my purse on the floor! And then they didn't bother to clean up the water! And lastly even though my bf and I both got deluxe pedis they did not do the same things for both of us. I don't know if they just customize the service depending on your needs or what but it really just seemed like my bf's nail girl skipped his salt scrub and mine skipped my leg massage. Overall, it was a good pedi. Our toenails look perfect, clean and shaped. Our feet are soft and smooth, that cheese grater really worked! I was nervous about it, but it was not uncomfortably and my feet really needed it. Okay selection of polish but I think I will bring my own next time if I want a specific color. We will be back but next time with appts."
0,"I booked this hotel room hoping for a \""4 star experience\"" in Las Vegas. When we arrived in the room, it smelled like mold and smoke (even though it was categorized as NON smoking), the carpet was dirty, and the hotel receptionist wont move our rooms unless we paid an extra 40 dollars per night to \""upgrade\"" to a newly remodelled room. Being desperate for comfort and cleanliness, I went ahead and paid the extra 80 dollars to upgrade. I am writing this letter to communicate my disappointment to hotwire's online description of the hotel. I felt mislead and deceived from the hotel description. \nMoral: not all \""deals\"" from hotwire leads to a happy ending.\nBlah."
3,Go yard or go home! The strawberry and mango flavor is refreshing. I usually like pina coladas but the miami vice didn't have the same kick of the strawberry and mango. If you could put fun in a bottle...it would come in a yard size.
1,"My wife absolutely loved her turkey burger, and the fries were decent if not spectacular.  So why the 2 star rating?\n\nThe service was absolutely awful.  This was at the South End food truck meet up on Friday night.  By the time we got there (8ish) the lines were dying down.  My wife ordered from here while I went elsewhere to order.  The line was longer where I went so by the time I got back she was already waiting for her food.  Then we went to Common Market to pick up a couple of beverages.  We came back and my food was just coming out.  Hers was nowhere to be seen.  It was another half hour before it came out.  I was watching the whole time and it wasn't like they were overloaded with orders - it took them between 5-10 minutes to put out each order.  Absolutely crazy!\n\nMy wife liked her burger so much that she said she would eat there again, but it will have to be without me because I won't wait."
3,Best patio in town.  Only visited once so far.  Food above average and the menu has a good variety that goes beyond basic bar food. Service and the patio were A+.  The place just has a cool vibe to it.  Can't wait to go back.
4,"Just happen to be going for a show and decided to reserve table at Orange Sky.  I had been there several times before to sit in one of the private booths overlooking the city which I highly recommend especially for special occasions.  This time however ate out in main area...Christopher was our waiter and he did a great job serving us.  I usually have fish, but Christopher recommended the fillet and boy was I glad he did!!!  It was way better than the steak I had only a few weekends ago at Dominick's Steak house and about half the price.  This steak melt in your mouth...\n\nI am a local Realtor in town and clients always ask me where to go...now I will replace Dominick's with Orange Sky.  Two thumbs up for Christopher as well, we will request  you in near future as I am already thinking about how good it was!!!"
3,"I have seen every exhibit that has come through here in the last 5 years.  There are a few misses, but most are hits.  \nStart at the top and work your way down.  And don't forget to use the photobooth before you go.\nThe Weekend Factory is great for kids- the studio in the basement is open for visitors to make some art to take home with them."
2,"Great little brunch spot. All local and organic food. Service was friendly, atmosphere was a little lacking. Will definitely go back."
1,"The hotel feels old in general. It has this heavy perfume which we didn't care about, but can probably get annoying.\nNo WIFI, no coffee machine in the room. Not a big deal unless you're traveling with a baby and you're forced to spend $2.50 at Starbucks each time you need a cup of warm milk.\n\nWe didn't purchase early check-in, so we left our luggage at the bell desk. When we came back, we had to wait 15 min for the guy to get our bags out of the room, because he was eating a sandwich. He later explicitly complained about us not tipping him.\n\nThe TV reset its volume every night, and lowering it with the remote just made it jump to max, then go down very slowly. Also it was difficult to find real TV channels among all the hotel's self-advertising crap (which includes messages on the room phone)\nThe beds were comfortable and the room was clean. Nothing special, although the slanted windows and the Egyptian themed furniture were cool.\n\nSecurity was extremely annoying about having the baby in the casino. We never had the baby near us while playing, and still we got warned.\n\nThe restaurants at the Luxor have pretty low ratings on Yelp, so we only tried Backstage Deli, which was quite disappointing.\n\nThe monorail seems like it was made to confuse people. It only stops at the Luxor when going north, which means it's faster to walk from the Excalibur and to the Mandalay.\n\nGood value for the price, but I don't think I'm booking this hotel again."
2,"For our first meal in Vegas, we decided to go Mexican. After walking around the Miracle Mile Mall, this was the first thing that caught our eye. Location wise, it's probably not the best considering you'd have to go all the way around the one mile mall to get to where it is. \n\nChatty staff, good service and an awesome selection of food (platters, wraps, burgers, sandwiches etc). I ordered the Honey Mustard Chicken Wrap and Chips and Salsa. My friend got the BBQ Chicken Wings. My wrap had chunks of avocado, which wins big bucks in my book. I love avocado especially if it's integrated nicely into a dish. It makes me very happy. It was quite a portion actually. One of my concerns was that it was quite greasy. But I guess I can't expect a lot from fast food. I wasn't aware that there was going to be a side of chips (which I believe were deep fried, hand cut potatoes). If I knew this, I wouldn't have ordered the side of chips and salsa. No biggie on those, just chips and salsa. \n\nThe wings were also just ordinary. It wasn't bad but it wasn't to die for either. \n\nI like the nice island in the middle of the store that held all the dips and sauces. I thought that was pretty cool. There was a nice variety that patrons can enjoy.\n\nPerhaps my favorite part about this store was the line up that leads to the alcoholic drink orders (there was a line for non alcoholic orders and a line for alcoholic orders). They have these really tall plastic containers that held slushie drinks. I got the smallest one, which was a half yard long slushie drink, (double shot of course) named Happy Ending. I loved it so much I came back for seconds. Really great for those days when you walk down the strip and its 35 degrees hot out. \n\nOh and if you save your drink container and bring it next time to get your drink, it's cheaper. Some people actually brought theirs back. I should have, but seeing as I was drunk for virtually the entire trip, I don't remember where I put my first container so I just got another one.\n\nWould I come back? Probably for the food. Definitely yes for the drink. Me wants me Happy Ending."
2,"3.5, but more of a 3 than a 4 so I'll round down.\n\nThanks to Groupon, I was well fed for the rest of the day for only $8.\n\n- Smoked Turkey w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Honey Oat Bagel: WIN!!!\n- Ham w/ Egg and Cheese on a toasted Whole Wheat Bagel: LOSE (ham was too salty)\n- Chicken Salad on Whole Wheat: LOSE (too much sodium)\n- Coffee: Not a win, not a lose either\n\nI'll be back to try some of the other items on the menu (and to use up my other Groupon offers). \n\nAs far as the service goes, I didn't have any issues with the workers there. They weren't overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either."
3,Wow I love to Thrift shop. It's so fun to go to Goodwills when I'm traveling. So many different things. This store was huge! So much bigger then the ones near my home town. I could have spent along time going through the clothes. They were very busy Nd there racks were stuffed. The prices are doubled compared to my hometown Goodwills. Maybe because it's Vegas. Shirts in my area run for 3.95 a piece this store look liked 5 dollars and up. Still reasonable but that is my only complaint.
3,"Very good pizza and service, impressed so i went back the next weekend and ordered 3 more pizzas. Friends liked them too. Favorite so far is the delux and then the pepperoni"
3,"I have a ball every time I go to Ak-Chin Pavilion but I think the level of enjoyment one experiences often depends on the state of mind. Doesn't hurt to remember that you're in the same place as thousands of other people and your experience is not dependent on them, but rather on YOU.\n\nAk-Chin is an outdoor amphitheater in the middle of BFE where everyone drives, parks for free, attends a great concert, then tries to leave at the same time and get upset about it. My friends and I try to be somewhat responsible and book a nearby hotel and use a taxi service to get to the concert. When the concert is over, just walk to the QuikTrip on the corner right outside of Ak-Chin and catch a cab back to the hotel. It saves us the headache of trying to navigate our way out of the lot which can take a good hour. \n\nAk Chin puts on a great show with fantastic sound and great projection screens. We  paid for actual seats in a section for Blake Shelton but quickly realized the better way to go is with lawn seats. Lawn seats were my first choice but someone in my party wanted to be closer. When I'm at a concert, I'm pretty much dancing and singing as are all the people on the lawn. Not everyone in my section felt the music in the same fashion and stayed seated for most of the show so my girls and I got a few looks but truth be told, I paid the same amount of money as they did and if I want to show my enthusiasm by standing and dancing, I'm gonna do it. But from now on, I'll stick with the lawn. It's a better crowd anyway.\n\nDrink prices are no more than any other concert venue and there are plenty of choices, even a tequila bar. Better food would be nice though. A hard pretzel for $3.50 and cheese sauce for an additional $4 is a little steep. I'd pay quite a bit more to have a decent meal from a local restaurant down in the food and drink area. \n\nMisters cool the crowd down in the food and drink area which is very welcome because it gets HOT jamming out in the middle of summer!"
0,One of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  Terrible service.  They forgot to bring out silverware after serving our salads.  They brought out our dinner literally 90 seconds after serving us our appetizer.  Then they brought out a meal we did not order.  Now for the food.  The lasagna was swimming in an ocean of sauce that tasted worse than the sauce you get in a supermarket.  My meatball sandwich had a grand total of one and a half meatballs  (three halved meatball slices) on the entire sandwich and my daughter could not eat her chicken fingers because they did not taste right.  How can you mess up chicken fingers?
2,"Not bad.\nOne star: Impressive lay out. \nTwo stars: The clams were awesome. \nThree stars: Quick to pick up dirty dishes at the table. Hubby had the prime rib and he thought it was decent. \nOne star deducted because they were stingy with the cut of prime rib (I could almost see through his slice. Just saying)\nOne star deducted: THEIR \""CREME BRULEE\"" IS LIKE CREME BRULEE ON DOWNERS! Gross and disappointing! Do NOT be fooled. Ugh."
2,"Just returned from a much anticipated visit to Pig and Pickle...much to my disappointment I write this in hope that those antiicipating thier own visit heed the warning.Following a long day as a bartender addressing the needs of others I eagerly awaited enjoying some new vittles and a new local place .When arriving I was greeted by a very pleasant and joviall bartender Scott...quite a treat. Ordered the croquet sammie and a glass of vino. Asked for house wine and was informed that a pinot noir was the only option....so noir it was. I texted a friend and informed her I was at P n P and feel free to come over and have a drink/nibble. My friend arrived and was literally not acknowledged for 10 minutes. Scott was no where in site. There was a man who we later found out was one of the owners behind the bar...not friendly...not attentitive ...certainly not a reason to visit. Earlier when he asked how was my food I stated the food was good but the temp was lukewarm and I would prefer hotter.Clearly he was NOT interested in my feedback and opinions as he scurried off and remained aloof and unavailable. Scott returns and we share  our disappointment with him...he is gracious and apologetic.....we press on, When presenting our check the owner bartender informs us that he has given us the industry discount( awesome) until my friend realizes that she has been charged 12$ for whatshe hoped to be a cheap glass of house wine....much to our shegrin the noir was not . All in all here it is....nice location...nice ambiance, food was flavorful, Scott was a consumate pro, the prices food wise were reasonable...they need a more affordable wine selection for  the working class. I am sad ...I had high hopes. I was  not at all impressed with the surly arrogance of the \""owner bartender\"" .He alone,was a deterrent to wanting to return regardless of the food and or drinks. Thumbs down on this experience~ Perhaps wait a minute...let them figure out the error of thier ways and this place maystand a chance-"
2,"What can be said about Kaba Curry? No, really. What do I say about it? There's nothing remarkable or memorable about it. It is a little place in the commons building that serves Japanese/Hawaiian style curry dishes. It's... curry. With rice. Sometimes other things. I know I'm being overly descriptive but that's just what it's mustering out of me. I mean just take some curry, pick a solid ingredient, and combine. I've just summed up Kaba.\n\nI do remember kind of a cool idea - a curry \""grilled cheese\"" sandwich. Just curry poured between a couple slices of white bread. There is potential here but it needs WAY more.\n\nIf you're in the area, really want curry, but don't want to go to Chinatown (and probably get it a little cheaper) then this is your spot."
4,"This place is great!  As someone mentioned, its a refurbished Wendy's.  It brings an old school feel to it, they have done great work on the interior.  You can use the drive thru window to pick up to-go orders.  Awesome.\n\nEvery time I have ordered here the food has been fantastic.  I always find myself going back to the Pad Thai!   The best thai in the area and quite possibly the best thai I have had in Phoenix.  Also a locally owned restaurant, support this place!"
2,"You should have some dessert here. I think ever since Fluff Ice came to Foodie Fest last year (velvety, perfect snow ice), this \""snow ice\"" caught on, but in lame and half-assed ways. You can get this stuff at Icy Juicy and Easy Life, but it just isn't the same. Not bad, but not the real deal. Anyway, having tried Kuma - I think they're the first in a wave of \""acceptable.\""\n\nFast service, rather tasty snow ice, and just enough toppings. I had the regular snow ice flavor with lychee, coconut, mochi, and strawberry syrup. I was a fan. I don't think it was too sweet, surprisingly, while being covered in sugar. This is a matter of opinion I suppose. I also sampled the taro, which tastes like taro. Surprise!\n\nIf you're a fan of this stuff already, you'll enjoy it enough because it's pretty much your only choice in reasonable distance. If you want the good stuff, you'll have to make the trip out to Frost Bites."
2,this airport confuses me when i get off the plane in vegas. i always forget that i have to take the tram to get to the baggage claim area / out the airport. i like how it is so easy to find the restroom right when i get off the plane. LOL\n\ni like how this airport has some last minute gambling or start your gambling right when you land into vegas. i remember one time my friend and i were stuck at the airport due to a delayed in our flight -- we were at the slot machines to pass by time. \n\nyou have to remember that there are 2 exits -- the exit closest to the baggage claim is where the shuttle is. and the exist away from the baggage claim is where the taxi line is. i was so lost and confused when i step out the airport looking for a taxi. i exited to the shuttle area and had to walk back into the airport to the taxi area. Getting a taxi was super easy. There is a a line and the line moves pretty quick since every taxi is waiting for business. \n\ni hate how the gates to my flight was so far away from the security area. it was seriously a 10 min walk!
3,"We come here all of the time to eat and go to the movies and we finally had time to ourselves and booked a room for the night. Overall the hotel was great and we had no issues. We parked at valet, checked in easily and made our way to our room. You have to have your room key to use the room elevator so don't lose your key!\n\nThe room was spacious; we had a king bed. We were on the 10th floor and realized walking down our hall that our view was going to be the parking lot at Costco or the parking structure for the hotel. It was the latter. My husband only gives me the best.\n\nI didn't pack toothpaste  and they didn't have any in our bathroom so I called downstairs and they brought up 2 dental kits. Nice.\n\nI took a hot bath while watching the results to AGT. There was a tv above the faucet in the tub and the tv was actually pretty crappy. The remote didn't even work and I'm thinking maybe it's been dropped in the tub too many times? This tub was awesome though. It wasn't a roman tub but it was rectangular and super deep. I honestly floated in this thing.\n\nI used the gym once. It is on the ground floor where the spa is. There is a tv attached to every elliptical, bicycle, and treadmill. They offer ear buds for listening to the TVs but I declined. There were a lot of machines and a lot of weights. They provide towels and bottles of water at every machine and there is a side table full of cold water. I liked the gym. Now I need to go back and try the spa.\n\nWe ate at Hachi for dinner and the buffet for breakfast.\n\nWe had a really nice experience here and I can't wait to come back for another night or two!"
3,"Everybody's got their own opinion of Amelie's, so let me make mine to-the-point:\n\nDecor - love it. Unique, fun, and eclectic. My girlfriend thinks it's adorbs. I like it cuz it doesn't look like every other damn place in town.\n\nSavory food - like it. The sandwiches are AMAZING, as is the quiche. The salad choices are fine, but they don't really do anything that would be considered an entree.\n\nBakery - Also like it. Everything Amelie's does is wonderful. You are *required* to try the chocolate torte sometime before you die. There is no option here. The twice-baked croissant makes me masticate just thinking about it. The tea cakes are om-nom-arrific. The French macarons are excellent. However, Amelie's commits a major cardinal sin here that I simply can't avoid writing about: THEY LEAVE THE FRENCH MACARONS IN THE FRIDGE ALL DAY, MAKING THEM HARD AND CRUNCHY. I mean, seriously, who the FUCK decided this was a good idea?! Have they never had real macarons before?! Now, I know what you're thinking: \""Aubrey, not *everybody* knows how a macaron should taste.\"" That's true, gentle reader, but if you're going to fucking make macarons for people to purchase and consume, you should know how they're stored / kept fresh. Any other way, and you might as well hold your glaring deficiencies out for the world to see. In this case, Amelie's is walking around with a hideous facial birthmark.\n\nCoffee - meh. Ees okay. Not great. The melange riche is burnt-tasting, while the house roast is better, but still thin and bland."
0,"Great ambiance? My half blind grandmother could put together better low lighting with ikea lights than this place.  $11 cocktails with well alchohol? Do I look 15 to you, that you think I cant tell the difference between a plastic bottle of vodka and a vodka that should be in a cocktail that merits an $11 price tag?  I've been to many of the great \""cocktail\"" bars in many different cities (The Whistler in Chicago being the best).  Worst of all, we leave there after sitting in a corner booth on a not busy night, my girlfriend realizes she forgot her phone there and we return not 5 minutes later and the phone is mysteriously \""missing\"" yet the same lighter she had in her purse is sitting conveniently on the bar. right. I recommend never going to this place, I'm sure I could probably get a better drink in prison"
0,"The horrific experience that I had here a few months ago popped into my head, so I figured that I'd write a quick review. I'm happy to see that it had closed because i would NEVER have gone back.  It wasn't that the pizza was mediocre, it was that it was just plain bad.  So much so that i threw out an entire large pizza after eating just one slice.  Major disappointment."
3,"Cheba Hut had a vision from an Amsterdam trip and is growing the dream to legally sell Chronic, ATF, Kush and more. \n\n   I get the special of the day because this is a rare place were most of the sandwiches are worth the try.  I also treat my self to a rice Krispy treat.  The restaurant has been seen as a great concept and can be found in many states. Its great to see a business find success with a Hippy concept.  \n\nErik T. thinks Subway is great, go ahead man yelp about all the great subways in AZ I can't wait to read them."
1,Seeing how the one in Chandler closed we drove to the one in Mesa.  Came early 4:30 pm  for dinner on Sunday.  We sat in the bar in one of the booths for dinner.  Order was taken promptly by bar person.  While waiting for food we had the house wine ($3.00 per glass at happy hour) it was very good.  The food took 30 min to arrive.  Food was good although portions were a bit small.  The bread and olive oil was very good.    Restaurant was almost empty you would think the service would be better.  Never saw the manager to check on us.  They need to step it up a notch.
1,"well we had breakfast here...... big mistake...... the hostess was taking a waiting list, our friend jim tryed to give him his name to put down... the lady had to repeat jim back to him 3 times cause she didnt understand english, finally she wrote down GIAM, ?? wtf.... after waiting 1 hour just to be sat , we found we were being skipped due to her poor language barrier, and then we weresat.........\n\nThe food? yep, worst than dennys... need i say more? naw im good."
4,Eastfield Bar and Grill has a very friendly staff. Yummy food. My family loves the chicken fingers. Clean.
0,"This place is bait n switch unless you know what crooks you are working with and know how to handle them . Of course I'll share my experience and give you some tips !\n\nSome customers literally took 30-45 minutes at the counter while the clerks here tried to up sell every thing possible, gps, gas, insurance, car seat to people who obviously have no kids . Time is money! Efficiency is key! 2 sayings that have never been uttered in this building obviously.\n\nPeople you know they will ask you for your drivers license and credit card... Have it ready before you are next in line . Also have your confirmation number pulled up on your phone or on your print out ready to go... Come on!\n\nWhen I heard those golden words \""Next customer\"" I felt like I hit the lotto. I passed the confirmation number to the clerk which was pulled up on my phone, and handed her my license and credit card. The next thing she said was do you was basic or premium coverage. Wait... What did u just ask me? What kinda question was that? Did you really just try to pull a fast one on me? Is that what they teach you during your training !!? Is that how you tricked those poor young girls into speaking with you for 45 minutes, holding up the line that was already going out the door?? I snapped back at her I don't want any coverage, no extras, I'll get my own gas, nothing additional!! My contract was printed immediately and I was out within 1-2 minutes. I think I set a record that day for being the fastest one out of the rental counter.\n\nComplaints about taking 2 shuttles you say... If you look at the location, you can see they are obviously located further away than most rental agencies..\n\nYes I'm herra asian so I will be back here to save my $40, but don't get tricked into any up charges and don't let these folks waste your time either. Come prepared !"
3,Out of Business!
1,"Average manga themed ramen spot in Chinatown Vegas next to Asian restaurants and an AYCE Japanese sushi restaurant and ayce KBBQ place.  I say manga theme because the cute waitresses wear colorful wigs and Japanese cartoon outfits modeled after Anime magazines and the menu has Spicy! and Hot! popping out at you in cartoonish fonts.  That's the biggest draw, though, because the food itself was somewhat bland and it took a long time for it to come out.  I got the miso ramen and split an order of kim chi fried rice and karaage chicken, but my ramen tasted bland and wasn't too exciting.  The chicken was too oily and the meat was dry but crispy.  The fried rice was just ok too but not that memorable.  I don't mean to nitpick, I guess I was expecting some pop out at you flavor and excitement from a cartoon themed restaurant.  I wanted to like it, it's a cute place and the waitresses are really cute.  I suppose a huge anime or video game fan (otaku?)  would be crazy about this place and want to try everything on the menu whenever they were in town.  They also serve boba."
3,"Victoria Street is one of the best streets in Edinburgh for shopping individuality and general quirkiness. Swish fits in well amongst the mix of boutiques and random outlets, and specialises in retro bags and t-shirts for men and women, although there is a really sweet section at the front with a lot of cute garments, which are mostly on the girly side.\n\nMessenger bags in different designs, Gola bags in a ton of colours, plus some girlier handbags in some very funky, patterned designs. There are also various jazzed up laptop covers, other little items scattered around to give as gifts, and my personal favourite, the t-shirts. The t-shirt designs in here are very cool, and just that little bit different."
0,"A big FU to the waitress last night at the Carolina Ale House in Downtown Charlotte.  First, my two beer glasses were filthy. No apology, no acceptance of responsibility.  Second, we ordered wings and we were never asked if we wanted ranch or blue cheese, a very typical side item.  You also failed to provide plates for the bones.  Third, when I ordered a simple cheese burger, I told the waitress exactly what I wanted. She came back with all of those specific items missing and asked if there was anything else I would like.  I politely responded by mentioning those items and she said she would be right back, so I waited.  15 minutes later, my burger is too cold to enjoy.  When she caught my eye, she said she remembered and will go get those items.  I said, never mind, just take my food and bring me the check, I'm done here.  \n\nHowever, I still felt obligated to tip.  Because, if I didn't tip, I'm sure she would have walked away and said; 'there goes another nigger that does not tip'.  And, I was not going to give her the satisfaction.  Besides, the bus boy and bartender did nothing wrong to lose my support.  So, she benefits because of them.  So, I gave the lowest amount I have in many years, 17%.  But, this waitress was f'n lousy.  Her name is Heather M (according to my sales receipt), so avoid her.  I'm sure the establishment is fine."
1,"Disappointing. My mom and I stopped by here after some late afternoon shopping, as it is located inside Scottsdale Fashion Square, and we were looking to party for our last night in town. We ordered a couple margaritas, and they were intensely sweet and too strong to enjoy. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoy getting my money's worth when I order a drink but there is a difference between a stiff drink and one that is so strong you don't want to drink it.) We ordered chips and salsa for an appetizer while we looked over the menus. Again, we were prepared to stay a while. It actually took 20 minutes for us to see our chips and salsa. The presentation was nice, and it included 3 different salsas to try. The chips were crisp and fresh. We were not offered any cornbread that other tables were getting. By the time we had finished the bowl of chips, we had not been offered any more drinks, or asked for our food orders. It wasn't very busy, so I was confused as to what was taking so long. Since I work in the industry, I think I show more patience than most, but this was just pathetic. Finally a second bartender came on and asked if we were doing okay and we asked for our bill. From the moment we sat down, we spent over an hour there, and all we had to show for it were some chips and salsa and a couple of bad drinks. It was a total mood killer for the two of us who were prepared to party and spend our money at Z'Tejas. Lesson learned!"
4,"This is a great service, I have used this on three occasions to buy show tickets and tickets to exhibits. This really saves you a lot of money, in some cases 50% savings on a show or an exhibit. \n\nThe only downside is there always seems to be a long line to get the tickets, and when you buy your tickets you don't get a ticket, just a voucher which you have to go to the box office of the show to exchange for a ticket. The only problem I had with this is when I went to see an exhibit, waited in line for a half an hour for the voucher, then went to the actual exhibit and had to wait for another half hour for a ticket. But with the savings you get it is worth the hassle."
0,This is a review of the snack bar area. I love Target but the snack bar area is a freakin dump! Every single table right now is filthy and doesn't look like they have been cleaned all day. Gross...and they aren't even busy. I wish the health dist would pay thus slop hiuse a visit.
0,"So we were hung up on again will trying to get the key the opportunity,to correct her problems. Very unprofessional if you sold equipment that work there would be no issue. If looking for appliances go to Home Depot or Lowe's"
0,"I weep for humanity.\n\nWords like \""horrifying,\"" \""embarrassing,\"" and \""tragic\"" should be used when describing this culinary disaster.  Our group of four had to hunt to find anything edible just to get past the meal.  \n\nWe could taste the cheapness in the food.  It was like the dishes were assembled  in another country, frozen, shipped, accidentally thawed, re-frozen and then reheated for the Luxor's unsuspecting dining victims.  \n\nThe Luxor should be ashamed and management should be forced to eat here daily."
0,"Way to ruin a good thing PTs!  Sitting here 5 min ,\nPlace used to have the best PBR on this side of town.  The renovations are nice.  LED lighting brightens up the bar but looks half ass installed.  Nice pool table area where the restaurant side used to be.  Yep no more good breakfasts with the family.And the very worst! This place used to have the best steak sandwiches in town. Now it's some processed and high amount of preservatives.  Steak was grey !   The corporate monster strikes again."
0,"We were also one of the customers who used the restaurant.com coupon. I had been to this place once before and thought it ok enough to return. Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor. We tried to get their attention but they ignored us. We finally got up and grabbed towels to clean it up... only when we did this did they take notice. \n\nI will never go back to this place."
3,"Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.  \n\nFirst, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\n\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. \n\nThird, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \n\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \n\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.  By the time dessert came, I was full beyond comfort and had to pack it up.  \n\nOverall - I enjoyed the dining experience at Il Fornaio and would recommend it to everyone (who isn't on the Atkins diet!!!!)"
2,"Went here last week for the first time for a brow wax. First thing my waxer did was complain that she had just burned the roof of her mouth on hot queso she'd scrapped off the bottom of a crock pot. Not too alarming except for the fact that her job requires the exact same skill set to apply hot wax on people's faces! Um, let's use some common sense and not scare away your customers. Moving on."
4,"Yum!! Thanks to Yelpers I had a great breakfast every day here! We stayed at THEHotel at Mandalay and I used yelp to find a decent place to have breakfast. I'd recommend. They have a mimosa buffet breakfast on Sundays with an amazing bloody Mary! We ate here Sat and Sunday. Sunday had the omelet bar with premium ingredients (i.e. crab, asparagus) and each day they had someone making baby donuts and hand dipping them in front of you with different toppings! I want to go back!"
2,"Great pizza, weird menu set up. I would have though that a pizzeria would have their own little creative pizzas, but they dont. They give you a 8 1/2 by 22 inch menu that has plain pizza sizes and prices then toppings below that are $2 each , salads , sodas, desserts. We ordered a small pepporoni with ricotta cheese, DEEELICIOUS!!!\n\nOur waitress, very blah. I'm in the bar industry and i dont know if she was having a bad day or just hated her job but she def. wasn't attentative as she should have been. I had a cranberry juice and a water and both were empty most the time, she never refilled my drinks, I had to ask the busser to do it and it happily did it. Also, I noticed she delieved pizzas to her other tables and put a piece of pizza on each persons plates at the tables but ours....no big deal but again, strange. She also never made eye contact when talking to us, which I found odd.. I'll probably go to the straight to the bar next time, or get pizza to go.\n\n\nA Plus, Tuesdays are 1/2 off wines! I went on a Tuesday but unfortunantly for me I was taking the day off from drinking lol."
2,Food was good but the service sucked. They stopped checking on us and we had to go to the front of the house to pay our bill. Not really happy at all with the service.
1,"So first off you need to make an appointment for David's Bridal really? So I called and scheduled an appointment for 5:30 on a Weds eve I arrive at 5:30 &/ told them I had made an appointment first they couldn't find it then they said oh never mind we did & by the way you're consultant is working with another bride so you will have to wait ? Well why did I make an appointment then I asked ? they took me back and grabbed some dresses for me to try on and the girl didn't even help I got the gowns on myself so why do we need appointment? I think this place is trying to compete in a market of giving great customer service where they failed miserably the girl told me after I was there 10 min she was off in 30 min but no rush ? So why tell me then you're off when I had scheduled appointment and had to wait very disrespectful of my time not helpful i would not recommend. If I was their corporate office I would rethink things they need to be more walk in friendly and respectful of people's time , I will give them their prices are great for brides on a budget and do have beautiful dresses but customer service lacks and that's huge for me . I'm still in search for my dress I did find one I liked there but won't purchase unless I get a discount for my experience ."
4,"The food here is amazing and consistent. Love the noodles, chicken and seafood. We stop here every time we are in town."
1,"awful.  and this coming from someone who gives every place pretty much a four or five star review.  pizza was ok.  employees were nice enough.  but the parents who go here use it as free day care.  kids were running around everywhere, beating up on each other.  my kids, who are no angels, but know how to behave, were horrified.  parents came up to us afterwards and said \""sorry\"" - uhhhhh, too late, you think?  the owners need to screen parents and their kids before allowing them to come here.  this was not a mellow experience.  i still have nightmares."
3,"Outstanding. This place has a ton of variety! We tried both Breakfast (if you hit it right you get lunch stuff too!) and Dinner. Both were fantastic. \n\nDinner had an excellent mix of of cuisine types, tons and tons of delicious seafood...and all of the meat was great! I will agree with another reviewer...the Kobe was a little tough, but shit give it a shot anyway.  I mean it is a buffet at the Bellagio!!"
0,"I want to thank Mike (Manager) at Famous Dave's at the Peoria Arizona location. I was part of a large group we have had our local dive club meeting there for the last 5-6 months. Mike was so nice as to tell us that he didn't need our business and we could go elsewhere to have our meeting! We found a great place called the \""Salty Senorita\"" awesome place! Thanks to Jordan and her crew!! We had a great meeting.. Thanks again to Mike"
4,"Just ate lunch here today and my husband and I were really blown away! I got a carne Asada taco and a carne Asada mini taco and the husband got two al pastor tacos. Just FYI the \""mini tacos\"" are not mini, they're standard size street tacos and the \""tacos\"" are huge and loaded with all the fixin's; whole seasoned pinto beans, tomatoes, guacamole, sour cream, etc. So good!!! I tried my husbands al pastor meat and it was addictively good! Sweet and rich in flavor. We also ordered aqua frescos (I think that's what they're called, the fruit juice drinks) and I've never had anything more refreshing! The manager Greg let me get two flavors so I had pineapple and mango! Amaaaaaazing!! Everyone was very friendly too. The manager even walked to our table and took the time to talk with us and was so kind and welcoming. Very incredible service, has a very family feel to it. Definitely plan to come back whenever I'm in Vegas and try their nachos, fries and maybe a burrito too and recommend you try this place."
2,"Went to see Arcade Fire here last night. was excited to check out the Joint since they moved it when remodeling Hard Rock. Saw a bunch of shows at the old one, but haven't got to too many shows since my kids were born. \n\nHad balcony seats which I expected to allow me to go onto the floor also, but it seems they charge more for that and keep you separated. Could have snuck on but whatever. Went up to balcony, back to our seats in 401 Row J seats 7,8 and after the first 2 songs sounding like DJ train wrecking, I thought either Arcade Fire got wasted in Vegas or the sound is sooooo bad in those seats. I had a feeling it was the latter as no speakers were close and it seemed like a lot of reverb getting in the way. \n\nSo we got up and walked up front to an opening by the railings on side, were we walked into balcony area. Much better sound. Better view too. Stayed there for rest of the show which was great. Arcade Fire was awesome live and sounded great in new spot. \n\nThe floor looked mobbed but I assume sounded good down there too. All in all there is nothing special or exciting about this place as a concert venue, and I would recommend either getting floor or standing up front in balcony. They need to buy separate speakers for balcony seats in back. Very Lame for someone who might not have known it was just bad place to be sound wise."
0,"Like any fast food place, the staff changes often. On a recent visit, husband walked out because he said the lettuce was brown and looked awful and the staff refused to provide fresh lettuce. Also, the turkey was so shredded, it was unrecognizable as such. The staff refused again to open a new chunk of turkey until the little nub left was used up. When my husband asked Iif maybe they could slice it thicker, the lady said she would charge extra! \n\nAdditionally, when I asked for extra onions, the man making my sandwich (who appeared to be the MANAGER) was rolling his eyes at other employees who were on a break in response to my request. I saw you do that you jerk; I'm not blind! Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!"
1,"To me this place wasn't that great. I ordered a two piece catfish and the batter was super thick, staff were inattentive and no where to be found. It seemed pretty popular as the parking lot was full. I didn't even eat half my meal before I got a little disgusted for spending the money and hopped up to toss the mess in the trash. I'll pass and stick to Pete's Fish and Chips!"
0,"CUSTOMER BEWARE, this is a horrible outfit.  We took our car there for a regular wash, they left the windows open thru the wash, and broke the electronic holder completely off on a brand new Lexus, that cost over $100 and denied everything even though we had witnesses and a policemen right there.  Since it is a civil matter, we had to take them to court.  The lesson here is avoid unethical businesses, and that makes reviews like this one so much more usefully.   We ran into a previous customer that says this is normal operating procedure, and that he avoids this place, but comes here only for company car.  Not sure what to think but will NEVER come back under any circumstance.  OTHER CUSTOMER BEWARE."
1,Server was polite. Food was marginal and took waaay too long to come out. Beer selection very limited. The only thing that kept a smile on my face was watching ppl fall off of the mechanical bull.
0,"Seriously?\n\nThey have a website.\n\nTheir website does not have their phone number.\nTheir website does not have their address.\nTheir website does not have a map.\n\nI'd be tempted to wonder why, but I suppose if that's an indication of their attention to detail I should just take the hint."
0,I don't know what all the hype is about.  \n\nI ordered the Frrrozen Hot Chocolate.  Holy bland!  I could have kicked myself for forking over $10 for it.\n\nOverrated!!
3,Went here last weekend. First thing they seat you and bring you pickles. This was very interesting. The food was great. Service was great. Breakfast menu has a lot of options. Will go back often. Ok have been back a few times lately and the food was not good. Came out cold both times and portions are smaller. Will be a long time till I go back.
1,It's okay I don't have anything to say really the customer service is ok and the food is okay only had one bad experience where all of my tacos were crushed couldn't eat them with out a spoon it was horrible.
1,"Very busy and the for the floor show, I watched a small child dash back and forth from the dining area into the kitchen area and back again. Multiple times. I didn't like the floor show, so that was the last time I went there."
3,"Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito. \n\nThe chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter. \n\nWe are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise."
0,"Holy heck! This place was beyond bad. One star is too much. We were heading out of town for the afternoon and decided to stop off at Santa Fe Station for brunch. Our intention was to hit the buffet but the line was too long. The Grand Cafe was right there and didn't look too busy so we decided to just eat there. Now it is Saturday so the place wasn't empty but it wasn't terribly crowded as far as Saturdays go. We walked right up to the hostess, told her there were five of us. She said to wait while she found a table. I could see plenty of empty tables but whatever. While we were waiting, the manager came out and asked, \""How many?\"" I responded, \""Someone is already helping us. She went to find a table.\"" The manager then very rudely snapped at me, \""How many?\"" I told him five and then he turned away from me and started talking to another hostess. Meanwhile our hostess came back and led us to a table. \n\nOur server showed up right away to take our drink orders and then she disappeared. It took a very, very long time to get our drinks. While I'm on the drinks...the kids' menu showcased two drinks. They were very large photographs. There were no other drinks mentioned anywhere on the kids menu. When we placed our drink order my two youngest each ordered one of those drinks. We were told they are not part of the kids meal and we'd be charged extra. The drinks also showed up in regular glasses instead of the kids cups with lids. I found this very weird and misleading. Why showcase both drinks on the kids menu if they are not kids drinks?? My orange juice tasted really sour as if it were old. \n\nWe placed our order and waited, and waited and waited. A server for a nearby table saw my look of death and came over to assure me our order was being put on a tray right then. She'd just seen it was up and ready. Yeah, right. We continued to wait and wait and wait. Finally, our server showed up and apologized saying that the corporate chef was there. I have no idea what that means or why that means service is so slow. I was just happy to have our food. We had plans out of town and our tickets required us to be there at a specific time. We were now running late. \n\nOk, so the food...bleh!! It was sooo bad! My oldest son ordered the french toast. It was so soggy it was dough. My youngest ordered pancakes that were not cooked through. My husband had the same issue. My hashbrowns were the most disgusting I'd ever had...ever. They were bland mush. I specifically ordered an omelet without mushrooms. It had mushrooms. I had ordered a side of fruit. It came with tastless melon and one strawberry that had been quartered to give the illusion that i got more than one. Nice try. My husband ordered a side of bacon and it never came. We spent maybe five minutes with our food before giving up and deciding just to leave.  \n\nThis was truly a terrible experience and possibly the worst we've had in our four years in Las Vegas. We will not go back."
4,"We expected a long wait after we read the reviews before heading over for breakfast on the 4th of July...great service! And great food. Farmer's omelettes, breakfast burrittos and pancakes. We were are really impressed! We look forward to going again. But, please... Don't let the secret out about this gem! LOL"
2,Excellent service and presentation. Spectacular view. Wine list mostly a rip off although there are a few pearls hidden.\nSteak is mediocre and should be better from such a gorgeous high end restaurant (steaks tasted like choice not Prime in my opinion ). Not as good as last time I was here about 1 1/2 years ago.
1,"I'm spoiled by the old location we had here in Surprise where the staff was fun, friendly, and on point. This location, the staff is indifferent, in a rush, and don't even make eye contact with you when you order. I really hate that. \n\nThe menu is the same and the food is good. But the staff is what really makes this location a 2 star joint. They really need to get a personality!"
1,"Meh. The food was plentiful and relatively inexpensive, but it was also boring. \n\nI'll never understand how so many Mexican restaurants can make refried beans bland.\n\nI've had much worse, but I've also had much better. It was worth a shot, but I probably won't be back."
3,"Came to town for some training and wanted to try this place out. Not just because it was on Triple D but it got great reviews on Yelp too. I had The Five Spot with a side of homefries. The food was excellent, has to be the best breakfast sammich ever. The homefries are really good too, but the sammich was the best. Definitely worth checking out. I went on a Monday around 1 pm and the place was pretty full, but no wait. Its good enough to wait for though."
4,This is a great restaurant a little on the pricy side but it's very good the service was great and there is a lot of good people watching I was very intertained with the couples I saw coming in
3,"I only ever really go there for the movies, but I have to say, I love it for a few reasons:\n\n1.  Newer and cleaner than most others I've been to\n2.  Better ventilation - walking through the casino to get to the movie theater doesn't mean lungs full of smoke for my kids and me.  Most other local casinos, you just get slapped in the face with the smoke as soon as you walk in. For me = instant migraine.  Not at Aliante.\n3.  I left my credit card in the movie theater ladies room once and didn't realize until a couple of hours after I left.  I called, and someone from the staff had found it and turned it in.  MAJOR POINTS for HONESTY!  I will never forget how helpful the movie theater manager was.\n4.  Easier to find your way around.  I get lost in almost every casino I go to, but this one's simple to navigate."
2,"Went here for brunch because we had a voucher. Overall I was impressed by our meal. My husband and I ate outside on the patio which was very pleasant.  We ordered coffee (3.5) and I ordered a Bloody Mary  which was a little on the spicy side but tasted fresh and my husband ordered a mimosa ($6 each). We shared the seasonal fruit plate which has a nice variety of fruit  including strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, blueberries, blackberries, and pineapples, but the melon was not ripe and some strawberries were over ripe ($8). I ordered the corned beef benedict ($11) and my husband ordered the classic benedict ($12). The corned beef was a little dry, but I should have expected that! The hollandaise was tart. Best breakfast potatoes I have ever had! We made a reservation per our voucher request but the place was almost empty. I was disappointed that the Westin does not have complementary parking for its guests."
3,"Teriyaki chicken with soba noodles! That's what I get every time... It's pretty darned good for a fast food Japanese place in a mall! The food is cooked up on a big grill in front of you (with a bit of performance usually thrown in by the cooks ~ \""yummy, yummy chickeeen!\""), so depending on the rotation of the chicken, you may have to wait 10 minutes or so for the chicken (or steak, I guess) to cook up. That's fine, as it's worth the wait for fresh food. The teriyaki chicken comes with some traditional veggies ~ bok choy, I think ~ and a very light sauce. However, they do use some vegetable oil, so don't expect this to be the lightest meal you've ever eaten. Surprisingly, I found some threads on the web of people dying to reproduce the recipe, so I guess I'm not the only one who enjoys Sarku every so often!\n\nOh, by the way, lots of folks get double meat, but with the soba, I might go into a comatose state if I tried that one, so I just get the regular meat portion. It is PLENTY.\n\nP.S. I've heard you can do double veggie instead of the rice normally served with the teriyaki. I might try that, but it's hard to say \""No\"" to soba noodles. : ("
4,"Why do you think you are entitled to be head judge of the best cooking competition on tv?  \n\nWhat gives you the right to chastise the contestants over every minute detail?\n\nWhat contributions have you made to this world that make you worthy of even sitting at the same panel as the gorgeous padma and very underrated gail?\n\n**take my first bite of my dry-aged bone-in medium rare rib-eye**\n\nok...you're good....you're really good...you're light a cigarette while sprawled across the trashed bed in my boxers smiling so wide my cheeks hurt GOOD!!! (and i dont even smoke!!)\n\nAfter the first bite I let out an oh so inappropriate but oh so fitting moan and every muscle in my body relaxed and I slouched down in my chair like I was 15 again and back in my friend's guest bedroom feeling like I was on top of the world. \n\nEverything was impeccable-the sides of mushrooms, asparagus, corn, potatoes, the wine, the service and decor but ALL PALED in comparison to that preposterously perfect piece of meat that I devoured unrelentingly. \n\nYou just answered all the critics who said you \""couldnt win the big one\"" by engineering a picturesque 91 yard drive in 1:34 going 11-11 passing capping it all off with a perfect pass down the seam into the heart of the Tampa 2 to your TE who falls into the end zone with 00:00 showing on the clock.\n\nYou, my friend, are a god amongst men.\n\nWait...come to think of it, the line cook who prepared my steak is a god, youre still just a pretentious douche. \n\nAnd youre bald.  hahaha...im so clever."
2,"This hotel is just meh.  Nothing to write home about except for the fabulous location.  Didn't do anything more than sleep there, so I can't comment on the bistro or anything else.  A good place to stay if you can get a great rate."
1,"During the 1990s, when I lived in Montreal in my late teens/early 20s, I was a frequent visitor to Super Sexe and other Montreal strip clubs. Super Sexe was always clean and classy with hot women. It was always packed at any time of day or day of the week. I was very disappointed when I stepped in there in May 2011. It looks like the owners had not put any money into renovating it for the past 10 years. There were very few patrons, and the girls looked bored. They only had a girl dancing on stage every other song. After chatting with a stripper at Super Sexe's sister club, Super Contact, I learned that the weak economy and the weak US dollar has been keeping the tourists away and as a result keeping the strip clubs empty. It is really a shame. Some of best guys nights out ever happened here. I hope it recovers as the economy improves."
0,"This place is horrible. I've been in here a few times and every single time, the service is unacceptably slow and the customer service is really lacking. I went in there another time and not a single employee in sight. Wtf? It was in the afternoon so it's not like they were closed.  I could hear people in the back talking. I called out for someone to assist me multiple times. I waited there for 5-10 min for someone to come out and not one person answered me or even bothered to come out. What the hell is up with that?! Hello...I'm about to spend money on your damn food and you ignore a customer?  Ridiculous. The owner needs to find some better employees because these people suck. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE: I tried calling the store to see if I could get a hold of a manager to speak to.  The phone rang for a while before the phone was finally picked up...the person on the other line didn't say anything.  After I said \""Hello?\"" the person just hung up without a word.  Seriously?  RUDE and UNACCEPTABLE.  How do you expect to run a profitable business with crappy employees like that?"
1,"This is my fourth time staying at the hotel and I must say that the quality of service, venue up keep, and overall hotel experience is NOT what it used to be. We pay way too much money to stay here for it NOT to be up to par!!!"
1,I don't know if its the time I'm going but the attitudes are unbelievable. I cannot express how rude Tasha was to me. Which is fine because frankly i didn't need it anyways. Needless to say i will not go back .
1,"With Yelp as our guiding light in all things food and drink this place provides one of the most divided selections of reviews that I've seen on the site. To justify my two meagre stars:\n\nYay!\n- big range of whiskies\n- central location\n- appealing decor\n\nNope\n- service is so slow\n- seriously, haven't they picked up the message - people are WAITING!\n- I had a straight whisky, though friends had a cocktail that they failed to finish as it just wasn't very nice, which is something of a failing in a cocktail that you've paid a fair whack for\n\nSo, if you're in the city and looking for a drink - particularly an unusual or exclusive whisky - then this is just the place for you, so long as it's just about empty."
0,"I've eaten here 3 times and I kick myself for going back the other 2 times. The first time it was terrible. It was fish and chips and there was nothing but heavy batter, you had a hard time finding the fish, it must have been thin as a sheet of paper. But I gave it a second chance, figuring it might have been a bad day for the cook. So this time a got adventurous and had a rib-eye steak. What a disaster, it was cooked dry, so overly done I couldn't cut it with a knife. I asked for medium-rare. So, convinced I would not ever go back, until my neighbor begged me to go with her and again, terrible food. This place I would never recommend to anyone and I made it very clear to my neighbor I would not be returning."
0,"This place has gone really down hill :(  I was in last weekend after a hockey on a saturday at 9pm.  The ladies bathroom was gross.  The service was lacking in friendliness and timeliness-and all we had was beer and appetizers!  We used to love coming here, but will definitely think twice."
4,"We were looking for something to satisfy our hunger and walking into the Miles Mall this was the first place we ran into. There wasn't a line as we went there on a Saturday afternoon. You can pick your sandwich and add chips and drink to your order. They give you the buzzer and you wait for your sandwich to get done.\n\nI ordered the All American sandwich, which had roasted turkey and cranbarry sauce in it. It was very tasty and everybody else liked their sandwiches too. It tasted very fresh and the bread was soft in the inside and crunchy on the outsite. Prices are reasonable and staff is friendly and helpfull. Would definitely go back there."
3,"A little overpriced for the quality. The filet mignon was not as tender as anyone in my party would have liked. Also, the truffle butter as a topping for the steak was an extra $12. It's a beautiful restaurant, great and friendly service."
4,"If you are visiting Montreal you should make some time to walk this part of the Island. Beautiful little stores, cafes & the port are a few of the things to take in. Great to walk thru with your camera. The restaurants here are usually quite busy so book ahead and parking is limited so be sure to walk or take public transport! Be sure to spend a night or afternoon exploring this part of town. Old cobblestone on the streets so ladies leave your heals at home!"
0,"Attempted to sell a Toyota with a $8500 blue book value. The same car/make/year were being sold on the lot for $10-11K.\nThey were very nice through the whole process and appeared to be really interested in purchasing my car, which was clean and in excellent condition.\nOnly problem was they wanted to give me. $2800 for it. WTF!?!\nI understand they have to make a profit but over 3x profit on my car!?\nI politely told them to take a hike"
1,"You'd think it'd be pretty easy to have a successful restaurant with menu based mostly off of bacon, but Bacon Bar will prove that wrong. \n\nFor starters, the bacon jalape\u00f1os were one of the worst things I've ever eaten. No texture whatsoever. Mushy, overcooked jalape\u00f1os with soggy, limp bacon. And they added maple syrup to them as well, which wasn't listed on the menu.\n\nWe got THE bacon burger, and while it wasn't that bad, it still wasn't what we ordered. It's supposed to have bacon ground with the beef. Instead there was only bacon on top, and it was dry and overcooked. The burger also came with tomato confit on it which also wasn't listed in the menu description. So both things we ordered came with additional ingredients that weren't on the menu. \n\nOur server was really somethin too. There was nobody in the restaurant and while we were waiting for our food, she sat at the bar and ate her dinner while she was on her phone.\n\nWe won't be back."
2,"No. I can NEVER avoid a new Kabob place. Not ever. Frankly, I think I would rather eat a good gyro more than any other meat related sandwich, dish, or anything. I am not Greek. I am not of any mediterranean decent, but I have the Gyro fever and there is no stopping me. \n\nSo naturally I had to stop in when I was in Fremont to get a load of the Kabob Korner and their Super Gyro of course. \n\nIt was a Gyro which is good in my book. It was super if you use the word super kind of sarcastically. Overall it was OK. Really, I am looking for that yogurt sauce and lamb/beef combo to knock my socks off but this super gyro was pretty super normal. \n\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back here. Especially for the area it is really convenient to have the best food in the world so close to old town Vegas. Next time I try it I will update this review- I hope my mind will change or I will find that gem that they cook like none other. For now I say it is worth it if you have the time, the budget and the tase for a Gyro that you just can't kick."
0,"I think we made the mistake of coming here right before closing time, my seafood chowder was too thick and creamy with no flavor, my chicken was cold and flavorless, the sauteed mushrooms felt like they only touched the skillet for a second and my husbands chorizo omelette had about 2 pounds of chorizo in it! Gross! \n\nBad food and bad service ( I even saw a manager wearing shorts), don't come to this location.  Stay far far away!"
3,"This place gets it right with amazing coffee, friendly baristas, and a great atmosphere. \n\nOther places in Pittsburgh may have one of these (or maybe even two!) but, certainly not all three.\n\nA great pit stop while walking around lower Lawrenceville."
0,"I went on Saturday and they obviously were only letting in White people. All shapes and sizes. Some pretty and some NOT so pretty. The only thing they all had in common was being White. Out of 7 people (3 girls/4boys) only 2 of our group was White. The only way they were letting our mixed race group in is if we paid a ridiculous amount of money. It wasnt even just purchase a bottle. It was large bar tabs for EACH guy, plus entrance fee for EACH guy AND a special $20 tip from EACH guy to enter this so called amazing club. This bar is racist. Spend your money somewhere else."
2,"This location has been through a few iterations over the years, but it is now known as Shari's.  From what I read in the local paper (http://www.lvrj.com/news/40836542.html) it is a family owned and operated establishment.  Upon entering, you can confirm this, as it feels like it.  The staff was very friendly.  I went on a Sunday ~11am, and the place was jumping.  Could have been because of the recent write-up in the RJ, but they said that weekend business has been brisk for awhile now.  I had the monstrous breakfast sandwich (it has a funny name that escapes me right now), the wife had a burger, and the kids had pancakces.  All was quite good, and nothing felt fake or processed.  I am growing tired of the places that just deep fry everything.  Not this place.  \n\nI went for lunch a few days later, had their classic burger, and it too was quite good.  They have a sauce with it that is tasty, and they didn't bat an eye when I asked for gravy-fries (I think it must be an East Coast thing).  The Chicken Vegetable soup was really excellent, probably the best part of the meal.  Very fresh, seasoned just right.\n\nI reserve 5 stars for only my favorite haunts, which would leave them at 4 stars.  I took one star away, because I feel like when the bill was tallied, it felt a little pricier than it seemed going in.  Thus they get 3, which is still good in my book.  Oh, one last thing, they use great buns!  Not dry and stale like the stuff you get at some places."
0,What huge disappointment thankfully we used a groupon and only paid half. Everything overcooked Best part was the all u can drink. I'd say full love no thank u. Hell half isn't even worth it. If u ask me go somewhere else def not worth the wait. Plus staff horrible some old guy fell and no staff member seemed even concerned
3,"Went to AZ for a trip and saw a movie in this theater, looks like this is a local chain. \nI would say that its pretty clean atleast when i went. The screen size is decent and chairs are comfy."
4,"My quick summary-  Normal bar food taken to a whole 'nother level.\n\nI rarely travel to this neighborhood in Scottsdale, but when I do, I always stop at KO's.  This is a nice, friendly neighborhood bar.  The owner is a nice guy, the staff is always friendly & courteous.  They have fun activities, like poker tournaments, on certain days.  They have TVs in every inch of the restaurant, so you never miss a game.  You can easily spend a couple hours here.\n\nThe menu is pretty amazing.  They have your basic bar food like potato skins, burgers, sandwiches, etc.  But, the manage to elevate their food to something surprising and unexpected.  Their chicken sandwich with pesto & cheese, so good & unexpected for a location like this.  Yet simple enough to make you wonder why other places can't manage good food like this.  I maintain their sweet potato fries are the best in the valley.  Their mac & cheese is worth the calories and cholesterol.\n\nI ordered their grilled cheese one day, without tomatoes.  When it came, they forgot & added them by mistake.  Didn't bother me, I was willing to take them off.  But the waiter took it back, had them make me fresh one, and then took it off the bill.  All without me asking.\n\nAn excellent place to watch the big game or just pop in for a quick lunch."
3,"Visited Kyara on a Saturday night. Usually I had to wait long time to get seated; however, we were seated right away this time.We ordered plum wine (choya), pork kimchi, ika butter, pork fried rice, and ramen. I have been there for more than 10 times, but the consistency of the food is absent most of the times. The noodles for the ramen tasted bad and kind of puffy. Some servers are friendly and attentive. Some need more training on customer service. I would rate Kyara better than Ichiza, but I still do think they have room for improvement in order to satisfy more customers."
0,"I don't even want to give them 1 star, they deserve ( - ) stars if you ask me!!!\n\nMassage Envy is the worst company I have ever dealt with! Fist off my son bought me 3 massages from them for my Birthday. I used one of my massages on July 13, 2012 and they just called me to tell me my massages expire on August 11th because they were only good for 3 months, unless I sign up as a member! What's wrong with this? First, they were a gift and no one told me they would expire! Second, there is a law about gift certificates and gift cards not having expiration because it is the same thing as CASH, now I would think that this would fall under that same thing since it was a gift from my son. Let me find a lawyer and start a lawsuit and we will see who wins!\n\nDon't ever buy anyone you know a pacakage as a gift because they expire but, they don't tell you that!"
0,Come here to drink. Don't come to eat. The service is a joke. Slow food movement has a new definition.  We got our food one plate at a time. Torture. Seriously got here at 1pm. At 230pm still waiting on food.  Train wreck.  Don't order grilled cheese because they don't use oils?  Dry warm bread with melted cheese makes a grilled cheese. Wth?  Same with the hash Browns.
3,"So, I dug this show and I'm not a Soprano's fan.  They kinda had me at \""How Ya Doin!\""  When you walk into Soprano's you walk in to a strip club, they even give you stripper dollars.  It's kinda awesome at the kick off.\n\nHowever....the show starts and they make you watch this scene to introduce you to all the characters that are being lampooned from the show.  It pulls you out of this great surrounding and then makes you watch a play....not too cool.\n\nThat being said, the actors a fun to talk to and play with.  The food was kinda awesome. So, for interactive theater, the Soprano's wasn't half bad.  Be prepared to get out of your chair alot, there's more dancing and involvement than Tony and Tina's."
3,"Food was amazing. So crowded for a Sunday at two. We were just picking up goo and they forgot a taco, but quickly refunded us out money."
3,"Great place to visit while in Charlotte. I saw it on \""Diners, Drive-ins and Dives\"" so figured we'd give it a try, great choice!"
4,"This restaurant by far surpassed our expectations! We had the best service and food we've ever eaten at any restaurant.\n\nWe tried several appetizers including the gnocchi, stuffed lobster tail (which had lentils in bisque and it was phenomenal), pork belly, and beef tartar which comes out with garlic potato chips and was to die for!! \n\nFor dinner I had the beef Wellington and my husband had the american beef rib cap. The rib cap has marbling throughout so it was pretty rich, tasted fabulous!! The beef Wellington didn't disappoint, so much flavor!! Be prepared though, it does have a longer preparation time. For accompaniments we had the sauteed mushrooms (divine), Brussel sprouts, and Mac n cheese. My husband said the brussel sprouts were very tasty and the mushrooms were as well. The Mac n cheese was good, just a little heavy on the truffle.\n\nDessert had always been my favorite meal, so we had to sample a few. By far the sticky toffee pudding with caramel ice cream is the best dessert I've ever had!! It's worth the entire trip!! We also had the apple tart tatin which comes out nice and hot and the waiter places the wonderful cinnamon ice cream on top so it's served a la mode. The cinnamon ice cream is so smooth and delicious!! My husband is a peanut butter lover so he tried the peanut butter bar which he said was his favorite.\n\nOur service was phenomenal!! We had Matthew and Derrick as our servers. They were extremely attentive and were always there before we even realized we needed anything. Matthew was also very good in knowing the menu and made some recommendations for us. \n\nBy far this is one of the best restaurants in town!!"
0,"If I could give you NO stars I would. I went there on a thursday night at 9:15pm.  The tables were full but there were 5 seats at the bar. The hostess (manager) told me that it would be a 15min wait for the bar, seriously? there are five seats open! She then said that she had people waiting for the bar. Well, there was no one waiting and no one in the house next door. The problem is that people think it is OK to wait 3 hours for OK pizza and be rushed to finish because the media praises this place.\nThere are many places in Phoenix that are better (Cibo) without the Hostess attitude. Your a pizza place not the French Laundry! And yes I have had the pizza, on 3 different occasions and it's not THAT good.  If you spent more time training your staff on customer service you might be able to open another location but my guess is that your afraid to."
2,"This sis way out of my 'hood, but I wanted to check out the Outlets opening weekend. Parking was not the worst, but what they had their staff directing didn't really make sense. It didn't take me too long to find a spot, though my friend I met up with parked across the way at Westgate which was easier. It was pretty crowded giving it was the day after Black Friday. Just browsing, there wasn't too much that caught my eye. I did notice, like others, that there is a severe lack of food venues, and the line for the pretzel place was out the door because of this. The prices were I did end up buying a  few things were worth it, but I can't say I'd make the drive out there unless I was desperate."
0,"We ordered from this place last not and I am not happy at all. First off the lady on the phone was not pleasant, she seemed annoyed to take my order. She said it'd take 45 minutes to get my food delivered and it took an hour and a half. The food they did deliver however was not what I ordered. And it took another 20 minutes for MY food to get to my house. And two guys showed up this time in two seperate vehicles which I though was strange. I don't have a problem with that I just thought it was abnormal. They then had the nerve to ask for the other order back and then I thought that is super weird and not sanitary at all!! THEN the two guys proceeded to unpack that food and repackage it in new containers and bags I'm guessing in hopes to deliver it to the right person! EEEWWW!! They put their customers health at risk just to save food and money. NO THANK YOU! Then they left their TRASH on my wall outside my house (the empty styrofoam containers and the ripped plastic bag) because they apparently don't know how to throw anything away! When I sat down to eat my food it was ice cold and it was not very good. Needless to say I WILL NOT be ordering ANYTHING from them EVER again! I don't know what sort of place thinks they can get away with something as disgusting as that! But I hope they read this and change their ways because they're gonna make their customers very sick if they keep operating this way."
1,"Bought a season pass last season and was very disappointed. Went once this season on a free day which was nice of them. The water was still super cold but lines were sorter so we actually went down a couple slides. The wave pool is very mild compared to the one at cowabunga bay. Had a better time, but still not sold."
2,"It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based on its buffet only. Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \n\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\n\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\n\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\n\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\n\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review."
0,This place is a dump. Very dirty and grimy. The tables and seats are not clean. The waffles were ok. Nothing special. I would not go here again.
2,"Overpriced but usually can get what you need in men's cologne, interesting they must be doing great as the manager working the opening shift, would not open the door 6 minutes early as 7 people tried to enter just before 10:00 am."
2,"Good ethnic food in Phoenix, recommended by my local friend.\n\nPros:\n\n-Great lunch specials!!!\n-Koobideh was delicious, very generous portions\n-Great for a quick meal if you let them know you are in a time crunch\n-pitas were soft and fresh\n\nCons:\n\n-Location is kind of weird \n\nVerdict:\n\nWould come back here but probably only when meeting in the area."
0,Not sure what the hype is all about. Based on some of the other reviews I called  in to order the Grilled Pork Sandwich ahead of time.  I was told it would take about 20 minutes.   This  establishment looked rather filthy.  The one and only table there had not been wiped down.   Nothing to brag about.  The pork was lacking in flavor and I don't see anything special about the roll.    Sandwich was cold and sodas from the fridge were not.
1,"Met a friend for lunch at the Mellow Mushroom on Mill Ave.  Got there around 11:45, and we were the first there for lunch.  Ordered small spinach salad, which was very interesting w candied pecans, fresh spinach, feta, apples - very good, except the dressing tasted old. My friend ordered the gluten free pizza which was ok,nothing special, crust was chewy. Took over an hour to be served! Waiter was quite nice and kept apologizing - almost felt sorry for him.  Thought  the meal was only ok, and quite expensive."
1,"We stopped for dinner want to have a steak.  The mash potatoes and salad were good, but the steak was tough and of low quality..  The price of the food didn't match the quality of the food"
2,"Went here for a conference/meeting. The hotel is at the center of the Charlotte business district. The location is perfect and there are lots of interesting restaurants to visit around the hotel. \n\nThe rooms are fairly modern. Nothing fancy, but quite OK. The bathrooms are a bit outdated. The beds are quite comfortable. The noisy from the hallways is ridiculous. On a Saturday night you can hear all the parties taking place. They really need to isolate the rooms better for the noise. There is even a sheet of paper in the rooms related to \""non-disturbance policy\"". Clearly the hotel is aware that they have a problem:-)\n\nThe staff is not very attentive. They seem indifferent to everything. The door man could not be bothered to pick up my luggage, .... Just not the kind of service you expect from a Marriott."
1,"Oh no, a breakfast place that doesn't know how to make an omelet?  For shame.  Oh no, a restaurant staff that doesn't care if you enjoyed your meal, even worse.  It's really too bad because the first time I went here the place was decent, it's why I decided to make a return trip, even though it's not technically in my 'hood. \n\n I had the coffee cake again and though it is pretty good it's not good enough to have to throw the rest of the meal away.  I had the omelet with all the meats thrown in because it sounded awesome.  Good in theory with poor execution.  Instead of fluffy folded eggs it was basically cracked eggs with meat loaded into in and all scrambled up in a round shape.  You'd think it wouldn't matter but it was burnt and tasted just awful.  \n\nWhat was worse, when I went to pay and was asked how my meal was, I was honest.  I got a shrug and an ho hum, oh well.  I won't be back."
4,"Like others have said, great staff here. Mary is normally at the front counter with a big smile on at lunch time. Keep people this nice working here and ill keep coming back. You can get decent fast food anywhere, but great service is another story. Great job guys!"
3,"The all you can eat sushi menu is pretty extensive. At $26 for dinner it is right on par with other sushi places I have been to. The sushi is fresh, the steaks and meats are tender and juicy, and the appetizers like the gyoza and seaweed salad are tasty. The calamari could use some work in the flavor department however. The service there is second to none. You are greeted when you walk in by nearly all of the staff, the waiters/waitresses are friendly and attentive, and the bus staff makes sure your table isn't cluttered with plates and your drinks are never empty. The wait for the sushi can get a little long, so order up some appetizers and sides while you're waiting. Just remember that there are other tables waiting for sushi, and only a few sushi chefs to make all the sushi so patience is a virtue here."
4,"A trendy, upscale\""ish\"" restaurant on the east side? Finally! Loved the food, loved the decor. Now just needs some a clientele under 60 ;')"
4,"The best pizza I have had in a long time. Got the carnivore and a salad. I'm from the east coast and the pizza reminded me of the pizza back home, except better! The owner thanked us for coming when we left. I thought that was a nice touch. They are going to need a bigger building soon."
1,The first time I experienced this buffet was in 2009... and probably then I would have given it 3-4 stars.. but now.. something happened.. and it's not as yummy..\n\nI felt like the quality of the place has kind of gone downhill from my previous experience.\n\nThe foods were typical buffet foods.. the desserts were typical buffet desserts... nothing that really makes it stand out.. nothing that really tastes great enough for me to keep coming back..\n\nAt least it was clean..
1,Pretty confusing AIrport.   I still like SFO the most.
2,"Just driving by Camelback with an empty stomach... Mexican's food sure why not??? Padre's...we sat in the patio area... our server was nice... we order the ceviche right away, it was really tasty... after that we had the calamari which were under cook and the fish taco which were not bad but it needed more sauce or maybe a more flavorful sauce, it was a lillte dry :( ....  drinks were good...Happy hour menu looks nice, we might be back..."
3,"Fettuccine al Granchio, Astice e Gamberi: Homemade fettuccine with crab, lobster, and shrimp with a touch of tomato sauce, $38\n-Wow, this was excellent. Fresh seafood, fresh tasty sauce, fresh pasta. Pricey, but absolutely delicious.\n\nTiramisu, $12\n-They serve a small portion in this cone-shaped glass and it was some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Perfectly soaked lady fingers, not too sweet, light and airy mascarpone and Zabaglione. Would have liked more tiramisu, but the quality is excellent!\n-My mom got the Chocolate Mousse and that was excellent as well.\n\nDecor is very nice and overlooks the Venetian \""canal.\"" Romantic setting, with fiddlers playing in the background. You can ask them to play any tune you want (for a tip, of course); they even know the Chinese butterfly concerto! Prices are steep, but what do you expect from Vegas? Quality is excellent."
1,"$27 for dinner. About 8pm last saturday night there was about an hour wait.\nThe place was crowded, so much so that it seemed a little dirty, like they couldn't tidy up fast enough. \n \nThe bad:\nThe ginger ale tasted extremely watered down.\n\nThe stone crab claws were already cracked somewhat, but I tried a few different ones and was unsuccessful at getting anything OUT of them and also managed to slice my finger open trying. Friend got some of the snow crab legs, but they just looked soggy and aged to me.\n\nI was excited to see the brie and bacon mac and cheese, but was promptly disappointed by the quality.\n\nThe decent: \nThe lamb was good and not gamey. Crepe station was pretty neat- long wait, and not Spectacular, but worth it.\n\n\nOverall, I don't remember a darn thing about this food. So very unremarkable.\n\nand the good: \nthe reason this place gets 2 stars is the Creme Brulee!!! I lucked out and snagged some, but a friend went to get dessert and came back without, saying the chef was caramelizing the tops and they weren't out yet. I went back to try the remaining desserts and she asked me to pick her up a creme brulee, but they were out again by that time.\n\n\nCaesar's buffet is the same price and I'd recommend that. We had been there 3 weeks prior, about the same time (8pm Saturday night) and there was no wait."
2,"I walked into this place thinking: \""Oh man, you know the Americans(white dudes) are going to love this place\""  Flat screen tv's, nice tables, friendly service, trendy ambience, waiters who speak good English, white guy playing sitar at the front....this is white guys paradise...unfortunately the food itself was just above average. FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \""Americans\"" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \""The spiciness wasn't there\"" review\n\nIn terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\""Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\"" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.\n\nAnd to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj"
4,"My experience going here has always been excellent. The people are nice. I've never had any issues and the staff members are genuinely interested in my welfare as a client. I've only had one instance where they needed to reschedule my appointment, but they squeezed me in within a week. I don't have any complaints about the people or service here and I've been going to this location for over a year."
0,"Every time I go here something gets stolen.  First it was my friends purse, then the next time it was my friends jacket.   Last night it was my jacket along with my other friends jacket.   I have no idea what is going on here but everyone agrees this place is shady and at this point it seems too coincidental. Beware and good luck."
3,"I've been here four times and I'm digging it!  It's so far up north that it's a nice break from the 'watch-your-rear\"" Westgate thug-a-dub-dub-gangstafied crew.  If I were a gangbanger here I'd be throwing it up for the NORTHSIDE (carefree highway, baby).\n\nNever had a real meal here but I've had plenty finger food and a few troughs of alcohol!  Finally a bar that has darts, pool tables, and yes, occassionally beer pong.  \n\nI do have to disagree with Chris T's POV on the women in the Scottish skirts....c'mon dude it's women in skirts, bro!  Heck, I'd take a semi-hot girl serving me beerski's over a dude any day!\n\nThe outdoor seating is fun, nice televisions outside and usually a good crowd.  \n\nIt's a good mix of people.  It's a biker-friendly bar but you will find all types here and everyone seems to get along.  The only thing I don't care for is the setup of the mens bathroom.  It's set up so that when the door opens, anyone looking can see the mirror, which looks right at whoever's throwing a whiz.  \n\nIf you're up this far north, it's definatley worth getting your drink on."
3,"I had heard of ADC but had never heard him ;) so I listened to a short youtube clip and new this was not a comedian to take my mom to, so I invited a friend. The first opening act was funny and I enjoyed him. The second female opening act was pretty crude. Then ADC came out wearing shades chain smoking and tore up the 21st century modern women and their sexuality. I don't blame him one bit for leaving those shades on and using the smoke as a shield of protection while he truthfully spat out his horrors of ho's. Comedians are like court jesters informing the king that he's naked.. what a great job to get paid for! Beware paying $9 for a can of corona and $11 for a glass of house wine :/"
1,"My boyfriend and I visited for the first time ever on Thursday. I work for Darden, so I was expecting great service and delicious food. The food was nothing amazing, but it was still a decent value for the price. However, our waiter was extremely rude. He acted like it was a burden to serve us. I'm assuming it was our age, but that shouldn't matter. I'm a server myself and it's wrong to treat your guests like they are wasting your time. It made the entire experience quite disappointing."
0,"Wish I could have Yelp this place before taking my fiance here for a quick dinner. Lured by the giant golden fish tank, I was hopping this place will at least have a decent modern Chinese cuisine that equally match with its contemporary design. WRONG WRONG WRONG, The food is TASTELESS, OVERPRICED even though the service is the only one thing that is acceptable. I had the most Yucky Singapore style noodles and wonton soup in my life. SERIOUSLY, how could you go wrong with wonton noodles? This place seriously needs A NEW CHEF!"
4,"I was staying at the MGM and was looking for a place to eat for lunch and decided on Tap. I had the most amazing salad that was new for the summer. It had arugula, (what I think were) grape tomatoes, peppers, (get this...) watermelon, topped with feta and a vinaigrette. I would never have thought to combine watermelon and arugula but it was delicious and refreshing! Talk about a salad I'll never forget! I also had the chicken tenders after, which were also very savory and tasty. The customer service through out the restaurant was excellent. I was greeted at the front with a smile and my bartender was very attentive to my needs. I shouldn't fail to mention that Tap boasts flat-screen TVs that enclose the restaurant with sports feeds from all over the world. As a sports fan and someone who loves to eat, this place was pretty much perfect for me. But I have to say... That salad was pretty much the deal-sealer for me to have to post about it on Yelp."
3,"I love, love, love the pizza here. They have great beer selections too. They have traditional flavors and new variations. They had one that was a variety of olives on top - wow - it was great. Only draw back is it's usually pretty noise and hard to have any real conversation over dinner."
2,"Like most women, I'm a fan of Target. If the store brand were a band that went on tour, I'd be right up with the rest of them, throwing my panties on stage.\n\nBut this location is a little odd. It's right across from Koreatown and when we went around 4PM there were literally seventeen cars in the parking lot. So if you want to avoid a crowd, this might be the one to go to.\n\nHowever, what is missing in customers is also missing in staff and selection. Store layout is a little odd, and the first thing you see when you walk in is the little food court area- which zero people went to while we were there. The store also lacks a produce department- they would probably increase their customers if they replaced the snack stand with a fresh produce area. But that's my completely unprofessional opinion.\n\nUsually I can spend my weight in cash on the women's fashion department, but here nothing was styled or really on display and nothing caught my eye- a rarity for Target stores.\n\nFound the basic items we needed, at prices we expect for this chain, but was just underwhelmed. Other reviews say this location feels vaguely dirty, and I see what they mean but I can't put my finger on why- it's not physically dirty, but the lighting seems a little dim and the store itself just isn't as cheerful as other locations.\n\nService was okay- we were stuck in line behind a couple who racked up a $200+ bill but couldn't seem to figure out which combination of credit cards and cash would cover their purchases. Cashier graciously offered to have us check out ahead of them while previous customers got their payment together, but we declined. Throughout our visit, saw staff cleaning and reorganizing, and when we couldn't find specific items they were quick to tell us where to find them."
2,"My visit was very disappointing. The wait wasn't long for a table. All of us got AYCE so we planned on sharing everything we ordered. Everything I ordered the first round our server wrote down on paper. The edamame took over 20 minutes to come out. That was already disappointing. All the rolls came out a little after that. The 2 orders of Dynamite, grilled shrimp skewers & cucumber salad which is usually pre made was never sent out. I had to ask about the dynamite 3 times. I ordered a second round of sushi. Maybe 5 rolls. One of them was a baked roll & the server said it would take longer cause it's baked. Funny cause that's the roll that came out first! All the rolls came out & I still didn't get my Dynamite. When it did come out I started laughing cause the serving was the size of my palm! It wasn't even worth waiting for. The restaurant is nice inside. Small thought, but nice. The service was just terrible. My boyfriend has been here before & said the service was way better last two times I came here. Maybe it was just out server. She was the only one not in uniform. Just wearing a white shirt. \n\nThe buffet is priced at $24.95 per person not including drinks.\n\nThere is nothing special at all about their sushi rolls. If you look at the specialty menu they all say \""in:California roll\"" or \""in:shrimp tempura\"" with just different stuff on the outside. \n\nI will not be coming back here!"
3,"Who can abstain from visiting Panda Express every now and again?  Most people, but not me.  I need my Chinese food fix every few weeks.  And no other place fills that craving better than Panda Express because there just don't seem to be any other descent Chinese restaurants.  Most Chinese restaurants in Phoenix are terrible with a capital \""s\"", \""u\"", \""c\"", \""k\"", \""s\"".  Panda Express fills the void by offering descent, fast food fare with easy to order combinations.  The Kung Pao actually comes with chili peppers making it spicy and there aren't those large flat misshaped pieces of meat loosely referred to as chicken.  And who doesn't love pandas?  I get the up sale every time just in case the two option plate isn't going to be enough that day.  Or maybe I've just grown too thin like most Americans.  In any case, if you find yourself in Phoenix and that dilapidated Chinese restaurant store front staring you down doesn't look inviting, Panda Express is always just around the corner."
2,"Came here based off the reviews. Sapphires reviews were bad so we passed. The girls here are pretty good lookin just a few here n there that made me ask how did they even get the job. Seats everywhere and the I like how there is a center stage and a main stage.\n\nThe bad I came in there with no cash so the ATM was my first stop. Bouncer told me the charge was like 2.50 mmm no how about they charge $10 or 9% for every transaction which ever is greater.. I'm not really caring at this point until it hit me I'm going to be charged 10 for 20 dollars ughh PLEASE bring cash the ATM will kill your pockets as well. Women's bathroom ..,. Well u share it with the strippers and a Mexican service lady and the room is soo small you would think 5 strippers wouldn't hang in there taking selfies. The dancing overall was basic only a couple would do pole tricks smh and drinks are soso. \n\nIf u find a man on the street make sure u tell him u want ladies in free or u are not going"
2,I first heard about this place when I saw Hubert Keller on PBS. Was in Vegas and decided to seek the BB out. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was not terribly impressed. My wife's salmon burger was very good but the Angus burger lacked sufficient seasoning. The french fry dipping sauce arrangement was the star of the show (very good). Our son's burger plate was adequate (definately salmonella free).
3,"Great sports bar, tons of TVs with all sorts of sports.  Food is pretty good for a bar.  I ordered a grilled salmon salad and the salmon was prepared very well, it was not over cooked as most non-seafood specific places tend to do.  Server, Meghan, was very nice & kept my drink full.  Free wi-fi is always a plus."
2,This was my first visit to this theater.  It was located in the Palms Casino off W Flamingo Rd in Las Vegas.  The stadium seating was nice and the reclining seats were comfortable.  The $8 matinee was until 6pm.  My senior friends (over age 50) paid $4 today and a got a small popcorn and drink for $3.  And they have $5 tickets on Mondays.\nWe will be back.
2,"Pretty decent pho place. Been here a couple times. Che ba mau (rainbow dessert) is crazy good, I asked the waitress and apparently it's homemade or they make it themselves so it's fresher. They put peanuts on the top and it makes it even more delicious. Any pho dishes are good, I usually order the pho tai, i like my raw meat! Service could be better, some of the waitresses don't look too happy to be there but the food makes up for the mediocre service"
0,"My family & I go out to eat every  Friday,Saturday, & Sunday. I don't think we have ever had such horrible service. We sat at the table for 10 minutes not one person took our drinks or even greeted us. All the employees just looked at our table nobody ever came. When we finally got up to leave some of the employees said bye thank you. \nWorst service ever."
1,"Salads, soups, sandwiches, and cookies with a nice assembly-line-type set-up.  You do get a cookie with each meal, it's large and it's clean.  They have breakfast in the morning.\n\nThis just isn't my favorite place to eat - nothing is terrible, but the ingredients are pretty blah and the resulting meals are, as well.  On top of all that, they're not at all inexpensive for what you get, and the service is as bland as the food.  \n\nI only eat here when there are no other options."
2,"First, if adorable toenails are important to you this is the place to go.  They have TONS of designs to choose from (I don't just mean a flower on the toe) you can have plaid, polka dots, seasonal designs, everything!  I always get lots of compliments on my toes and I have never gotten the same design twice.\nThe salon itself is nothing fancy.  I guess it's what to be expected from a nail place by Home Depot.  Also, don't bother calling ahead for an appointment -- I swear they don't write them down and just take people as they come in the door.  \nPrices are reasonable.  Heads up, you can pay with debit/credit but the want cash tips and always roll their eyes if you try to tip on the card."
2,I finally got a chance to try out Maki Taco at the Food Truck Rally in Noda.  I met up with a few friends to find out what the big deal was about these food trucks.  I ordered the Spicy Crab Tacos w/ avocado and the Shrimp Hibachi. The food was delicious but I wanted more for the price I paid.  Call me cheap but 2 tacos for $8.50 was kinda pricey to me.  I ordered the Shrimp Hibachi for my daughter and it was $9.50.  It was definitely a kids meal size but a grown up price.  The shrimp were small but overall it was delicious.  I was still hungry after devouring my tacos. LOL.  The wait wasn't long and the service was friendly.  I would consider coming back and trying other things on their menu.
4,Great and knowledgeable staff that are ALWAYS willing to help or just sit and chat for a bit. Amazing selection of everything from bags to guides and if they don't have it they will order it and get it to you ASAP. They have great prices and give discounts if you buy in bulk or military which is always nice to be appreciated! The number one thing that I love about DRS is that they open earlier than any other store and have EVERYTHING you would ever need or want!!!
4,"This place is BOMB. For $5, I got the best burger I have ever had, some delicious and perfectly seasoned fries, and a drink. How do you beat that? And the guy behind the counter (Brandon) is really energetic and nice. You need anything, just let him know and he takes care of you. The first time my friend and I went in there, he asked if we had been before, we answered no, and he gave us the whole meal for $3 and thanked us for coming in. I was already sold and I hadn't even tasted the food.\n\nThe place is also real quaint - total hole in the wall/dive with a really cool patio out in the back. There is literally no reason for anyone in the Phoenix area to have not tried this place and had it completely change their life.\n\nThat's about it."
2,"It's the typical Harkins.  Yeah, I have a stack full of cups back home that I always forget to bring.  : )\n\nThey really need a better selection at the snack bar of some foods that are not high fat and high sodium.  And snack bar prices for what they do have are insultingly high.  They are pretty proud of their food."
3,"I LOVE TACOS! Safe to say i could probably have tacos just about every day and be a very happy woman! It was hot as hell for being mid October but still was able to enjoy myself. Two bucks a taco and we all had a decent amount. Good karma happened to follow us that day, a guy was leaving and handed us about 20 xtra tickets that he was not going to use. SCORE! So we were able to grub and drink even more than we intended. Overall I think that event was a success. I didn't have any trouble getting drinks as other people mentioned, maybe it was the time of day I showed up and it was less busy."
4,If only there was one of these off the strip! The dough was cooked to absolute perfection and i was impressed with the amount of in house ingredients and locally sourced dairy and produce. Even being on the strip you'll be hard pressed to find dining this good at these prices. While specialty pies top out at $15 you can still go for a Margherita at a shade under $8. Also while the beer list is not long or cheap they feature two taps from Goose Island in addition to fairly standard offerings. I found the staff to be pleasant as well. All of that combined with the proximity to other good eateries equals five stars for me.
0,"Found their rental ad on a zillow or trulia and received a call back from Keenan Gerson and set-up an appointment to see a house later that day.  We arrived on-time but Mr. Gerson was 15 minutes late.  Looked at the house and liked it but was very vague on answers.  He told us to just apply online.  So, I tried to do that but was not able to complete the application process after many failed attempts.  The next day I called their office and a lady answered and said that Mr. Gerson was in, then she came back on the line and told me he was not and wanted me to leave a message.  I did leave a message and never received a call back since.  Good thing because I found an awesome property elsewhere with great people showing the house.  \nAlso, its about $35-$40 application fee for each person going to live at the house, non-refundable.  Just a heads up to all who are out there looking to use their services."
4,"Stayed at the South Point for the first time and wanted sushi type of food, so my family decided to try it out since it's inside the hotel and the first time we ate here I knew I would come back. Sushi is just so good. Try to catch them on a happy hour time though cause they have a good selection for great prices."
2,"This place is really a busy location.  I walked in for an MRI expecting a similar experience to West Valley Imaging.  I was way off.  This was so much more crowded.  I started in one waiting area where I signed in and waited to be called up for paper work.  When I was called up I was moved to a second waiting room where I completed my paper work and waited to be called up again.  I was called up after a few minutes and processed in their computer system.  I sat back down and waited until I was called into yet another waiting room.  Waiting room #3.  I sat there for several minutes before I was brought a clip board with more paper work and two hospital gowns to change into.  I changed and completed my paperwork and watched several other people get called in before me.  I'm pretty sure some of them got there after me but I can look past that.  I did take some valium to get me through the scan so maybe they were waiting for it to take affect.  When I finally got called back to the MRI I climbed up on the table, put my head in a cage that made me feel not unlike Hannibal Lecter, and was slowly inserted into the tube.  It only lasted 15 minutes.  I was expecting to be in there a lot longer. I didn't even need the valium with how short a time I was in.  Whatever.  At least I made it through.  Steinberg may have a machine that I consider superior to the one West Valley but they herd you like cattle from one room to the next.  Its a little ridiculous."
4,Always great for a variety of wholesome foods and desserts! Everything is neatly organized.
2,"Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Vegas so far, which isn't saying much, since I've only had buffets). We had tickets for a show at 8pm, and ended up bumping up our reservation last minute to 530pm (when the restaurant opens) without a hitch.\n\nThe atmosphere is definitely very trendy -- black lacquer countertops, red roses, clear hurricanes of colorful peppers, fruit & red roses around an open kitchen -- and despite the business casual recommendation, there were many people in jeans and tshirts as well. \n\nAtmosphere/ service: The countertop seating gives you the best view of the kitchen, and feels like a sushi bar. The waiters are definitely attentive, probably bc they can't escape you looking at them when your'e done eating.\n\nFOOD\nMenu: There's a tasting menu, a smaller 5 course menu, tapas (about $20/ plate, NOT recommended), and traditional appetizers + main course menu. And also a theatre menu (L'Unique) with 3 courses all on one plate for $39, served in 15 min. We ordered the club menu, plus a tapas, appetizer, and dessert a la carte-- more than enough for 2 people. We enjoyed a half bottle of sparkling rose ($50, light and fruity but not recommended-- gave us headaches afterwards). \n\nOverall, the portions weren't huge but it was definitely very rich-- either with butter, cream, or heavily doused in olive oil. Such is French cooking, eh? (Actually, it was more Californian style than French, with the exception of a heavy hand in cream, butter, and olive oil in every dish.)\n\nBreaking it down: (updated from website; it's not posted there yet)\n1. Amuse bouche: foie gras, port wine reduction, and parmesan foam parfait. Salty, foamy, and well balanced, savorly bite to start the evening. Best dish of the evening.\n2. Mussels in a chowder: very creamy, also very savory and o\n3. Langosteen dumping with arugula/ spring salad - tasted like shrimp tempura, but the lobster was very tender; the salad was a pass\n4. Pounded veal - just OK\n5. Trio of goat, cow's,  and cow's cheeses (in order of robust to mild) served with walnut-raisin bread (best to eat on its own, or with a mild cheese), egg-walnut bread, and country bread (best with goat cheese). Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. \n6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)\n7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.\n8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!\n9. Sorbets and ice creams - refreshing ending. 5 scoops of mandarin orange sorbet (favorite), vanilla bean, coffee (both mediocre), raspberry sorbet (light), and pistachio ice cream (second favorite) topped with sugar crisp and 2 pieces of thin chocolate.\n\nOther information:\n- Our waiter informed us all the food was shipped directly from France, including the cheese. \n- Joel Robuchon makes his own bread (complimentary, bottomless bread basket with mini baguettes, country bread rolls, and buttery plain crossaints) bc \""he couldn't find a good bakery in Vegas.\""\n- Still water costs $8 (Evian).\n- Reservations recommended, need to confirm 72 hrs in advance to secure\n- NOT for vegetarians or vegans - every dish has seafood or meat except the bread. \n- If you're allergic to shellfish, tell the restaurant in advance and they have some menu alternatives.\n\nOverall, 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5). Quite expensive ($260 including tax/ tip for the two of us) but worth the money every so often."
0,"I usually like to give compliments to show a hard working person or company some love, but after my experience at this wild house, I had to confirm the negative reviews. After straightening out my messed up reservation, I proceeded to my room that I was told overlooked the pool, and after taking a look out the window, my \""pool\"" view overlooked the parking garage. \nThe advertised flat screen was on old television, the hot water was down the first night, no fridge or coffee makers and water cost $3-5. Just go outside the hotel get your water for way cheaper. \nEverything reeks of smoke; the hallways, the elevators, every corner of the casino! I got aa free and unwanted audio session of the couple next to me have a morning quicky at 8:45 a.m. (moans , groans, skin slapping, etc) and had to crank up ESPN loud in order to get rid of the noise. No shuttles, so if you aren't driving , prepare to spend or bring your running shoes.\nThe people selling stuff on your way to the room get annoying quick and you can tell this hotel only cares about bottom dollar. The employees at the deli and Rock & Ritas are pretty cool but overall the Place is a dump!\nStay away from this place!"
2,"I thought the steak needed more flavor.   It was too greasy, and not in the good way.  Fries okay.  Onion rings clearly not fresh.   It's a great idea with not so good on execution.  OK, not great.   It seems like there is potential, but needs help."
0,"Holy Crap this place is heinous.  Its really hard to find from the miracle miles shops, its hidden at the end of a long hallway.  I didn't order food so I can't comment on that but I can say that based on the cleanliness of the bar in general I wouldn't want to.  Literally and I mean literally every surface of this establishment is sticky and I was there at 12 pm so its not like people had been there all day making a mess of the place.  Half the lights in the womens bathroom were either not on or burned out, there was dried blood droplets on the floor, and there was a small bag with sketchy looking pills in my stall.  WTF is anyone in charge of cleaning this place??  I had a bloody mary that tasted like V8 and a shot of vodka- no olive, no spice, no garlic, no celery I could have made a better drink at home.  They have Sierra Nevada for 12$ a pitcher which in my opinion is the best deal but if you can AVOID DB'S PONG AND POOL"
4,Spak Brothers is the best pizza shop in the city. The wing sauces are incredible! Great people own the place and it's very easy to support.
4,"Some of the best pizza I have ever eaten. They have exceptional sangria, great service and staff, and the outdoor misters always wonderful as well."
3,"Carol has done my makeup for me for special events.  She says she gives me the California girl look.  In any case, I always dazzle after Carol works her magic.  I highly recommend her for make up, make overs, and facials.\n\nCandy Stone\nStone Talent"
0,"When we asked the manager, Alan, how much he would pay for the tattoos my niece received the night prior and his response is \""nothing\"" that is a clear indication of the quality of this tattoo shop. There is a big sign on the door indicating no one under 18 is allowed without ID, but no worries they won't ask for one anyway.  She and her friend (barely over 18)  were able to get tattoos by simply signing a consent form, and did *not* show their ID.  Mike did the tattoo and left her with dry blood and ink; I expect tattoos to bleed, but don't expect dry blood (that may have rubbed off his glove) 3 inches from the tattooed area.  It looked completely unsanitary and she left with no after care at all.  The tattoos were very simple in design, yet the quality is extremely poor with an outrageous cost -- as indicated by the manager's comment.  Yes, Alan did offer to fix the tattoos after they healed, but would you go back to this place?  Absolutely not."
3,Innovative southwestern cooking. Small plates can make a meal. The duck confit relleno is to die for. Truly a first class wine list.
0,So nice of them to close while they are currently offering a deal on Living Social. Don't forget to request a refund if you recently purchased yours!
1,"Extremely busy for 130pm on a Saturday afternoon.  Had to wait for a table to be cleaned.  You can tell they do alot of business. .. but the interior needs a good scrubbing.  The bathrooms are filthy,  the high chairs are black with grease..i can only imagine what the kitchen looks like.  The food was good. .. you hey what you pay for."
4,"Isaac was prompt, efficient, and most important , his job knowledge.  He took care of our two leaky faucets quickly, and thoroughly explained the work he did.  An invoice was provided along with a parts and labor guarantee.  This is a family run business,\nand I highly recommend that you call them with any plumbing problems."
1,"My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps \""offset\"" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.  I know not to expect too much from places that are meant to squeeze tourists, but there are many, many better places to go on the Vegas strip that give you much more value when they charge these high prices."
1,"Located in the newest Vegas hotspot The Cosmopolitan Hotel, Wicked Spoon was more like Weak Spoon as my expectations for the establishment fizzled at my first spoonful. \n\nOffense number 1: There were no crab legs. Really? Why are there no crab legs? If Paris can do crab legs, why can't the Cosmopolitan do crab legs? In all seriousness, they have crazy (ugly) $500/night rooms and ridiculous $20-60 cover at Marquee, minimum $25/bet tables and you can't even foot the bill for my crab legs. The hell? \n\nOffense number 2: Bland food. From the eggs benedict to the deserts everything was bland city. \n\nWhile the food lacks taste, it definitely makes up in presentation. All of the food is nicely presented - from the glass case full of french styled mini deserts to the individual take out boxes and egg benedict pans - it definitely brings self-serve buffet and hour d'erves to a whole new level. Sadly the food is not nearly as good as it looks and I felt like eating the bag of chips in my purse more than the food that sat in front of me. And although the presentation was nice I found getting the food back to my table to be a pain-staking process as my plate was not big enough to house no more than two or three of these mini pots/pans/boxes. I don't know about y'all, but if I'm grubbing at the buffet, I am grubbing. Period. \n\nI will never return and encourage all my friends not to experience Wicked Spoon. It's not worth it. Save your money, do yourself a favor and eat at the Wynn Buffet or Paris. They're much better."
1,They food is really good but usually takes about 15-20 minutes for them to make a sandwich.
4,Mexican Benedict zomg!
0,Never again.  When we first got there we saw dried light poop water splatters all over the toilet... inside and out.  We also saw menstrual blood on the seat and front of the bowl.  Called house keeping to clean and they a one-swipe shitty job.  The disgusting leftovers from the previous users were still there.\nSave your money and go somewhere else.  I've been to quality inns way cleaner than the MGM.  Ewww.....  totally unacceptable.
0,"Had to file a complaint with corporate office. Enough is enough with the horrible customer service.  I have four dogs therefore I probably go once a week to get food for them.  Every single time I stop in there is no greeting, no \""how can I help you\""....and when you do ask for help it seems like it bothers them.  If you don't like working for Petco please do not take it out on the customers. I really hope corporate talks to them and brings it to their attention because I will not be coming back.  I am going to go out of my way to find a local family owned pet store that actually still values the relationship with their customers."
0,You can't get anymore authentic than actually going to Mexico...San Diego was pretty close though. But now that I live in Las Vegas I can't seem to find a Mexican restaurant that can live up to Mexican authenticity. \n\nSo I did a drive-thru order for a chicken chimichanga burrito. Got the order paid about $9 with the extra $1 debit/credit card charge. Hmm.\n\nBrought the food to my hotel room...ate it. Disliked it. Too salty. Got mad. Threw half of it out. Still hungry. Went to Jack in the Box. Got an order of tacos and stuffed jalape\u00f1os. Called it a night. \n\nWould I go back?...No.
3,"I'll be honest:  I avoided this place for years because the name is just ridiculous.  It's hard to say.  It makes me sound lispy, and I just don't like it.  Now, my fairer half--who finds herself quite often having to talk sense into me when I'm too analytical and ridiculous (in this case, concerning a restaurant name)--is from New Orleans and explained to me the story of Chris' Steakhouse, and of Ruth's subsequent purchase of Chris' name, and thus the lispy-sounding restaurant that would become Ruth's Chris.  She also forced (or strongly encouraged) me to eat at Ruth's Chris to cure me of my aversion to eating here.  \n\nI really don't crave steak often, but I enjoy eating one here when I do.  The asparagus is pretty damn tasty, and the stuffed mushroom caps are to die for.  And you could actually die if you eat too many of them.  My main reason for visiting Ruth's is to drink scotch with my lady (who, because she is awesome, also drinks scotch) and while away the afternoon, chatting with the friendly bartenders and gazing at each other through hazy, bloodshot eyes.  Mushroom caps and Macallan 18 are the way to a woman's heart, my friends.  Yes indeed."
0,"Seriously worst waxing experience ever. I usually get my eye brows done when I get my nails done.. nothing to fancy its cheap and they do a pretty good damn job. So when my mom told me about the European wax center I was a bit hesitant, I'm comfortable at my nail salon however the first time you go it is free and my mom got 5 buck in her account for referring me so why not? Anyway so I mean its clearly says that this facility is a waxing center, they don't offer any other services you would think that the staff would be pro's however I'm unsure if the red headed girl I had was new which I don't think she was because as soon as I was done she happily greeted another customer by name before the receptionist gave her the form.  So I go into one of the waxing rooms she tells my about the wax how this place is the only one in the world that uses it (well maybe there is a reason) It did not work very well or maybe it does and she just didn't so a sufficient job. So she waxed me trimmed my eyes brows  then gave me a mirror to check it out.. I asked if she was gonna trim my eyebrows and the little snob says very rudely \""I already did\"" when I'm looking directly in the mirror and I can see that my eyebrows hardly even looked cleaned up. I had to have her re do them 3 times and by the third I was fed up and just left went home and finished the damn thing myself. I was not satisfied at all the only good experience about this place was the girl at the front desk. Not to mention the apparently they have a 9 minute no show rule my appointment was at 4:15pm she was not ready until 4:28pm, I will not recommend this place to anyone I had an awful experience and I will not return. Very disappointed considering this place specialize's in waxing."
0,"Not recommended at all.\nWorst place to go for Eye Exam.\nIt took us about same time as going to Emergency room in the hospital.\nNo point of taking appointment,they make you wait for hours."
1,"We went there twice last week and had 2 different experiences as a hotel guest in the Carefree resort.  Monday night dinner. Fine, better than fine. Good service, good food and it was quiet, not many patrons so we were well taken care of.....no complaints.\n\nThursday morning breakfast. Terrible. \nThey were expecting a large group to come in but we were ahead of the group by 5 minutes and the first guests in. No-one brought us any water (until after we finished breakfast) despite being the only people in the restaurant for 5 whole minutes.\n\nThe menu was cancelled and we had a buffet due to the large group I presume. This would be okay but the buffet was really poor. It felt like the food was made hours ago and reheated. Fruit wasn't particularly fresh.\nThe tip was included on the check. We cant figure out for what as we received no water, we got our own food and yet they included a service charge of TWENTY PERCENT, not 15, but 20. That took some cheek.  We didnt contest it , too much effort. We'd rather just report it here and hope someone reads it and decides against going. That was a truly awful breakfast.\n\nI tend to leave very positive reviews when I make the effort to actually do this but this was a really big letdown. I couldn't recommend this place to anyone."
1,"A lot of older hotels on the strip have had renovations in attempt to keep up with newer chic hotels such as Aria and The Cosmopolitan. Tropicana made an effort, but fell short. \n\nService is unreasonably slow, both in receiving service and trying to reach it. A little over forty five minutes for room service to arrive with food. We had ordered appetizers and a rare burger. The food was on the colder end toward lukewarm. Had asked for towels and had them arrive after forty five minutes and a \""reminder call\"". Same sort of service at their Beach Club restaurant. The people are wonderfully nice though. \n\nI wouldn't return. Not for the service, or the tub that doesn't plug, or the shower head that doesn't stay, or the long walk to the room from any entrance.\u00a0It's just not worth the money. The room was okay at best.\n\nLots of older people as well, not that it was an issue, just a heads up."
0,When I came to Vegas this place got so much talk but really these were the worst tacos I've ever had in my life the meat was so gross I couldn't even eat them! Not to mention the horrible service! definitely NEVER coming back!!!
3,"This is a great old steakhouse.  The steak was delicious.  Perhaps we went on an off night because they ran out of porterhouse and the steak came out cold.  The steak was really delicious and the service and atmosphere were great so I'm really going to chalk it up to an unlucky night because all the sides were delicious and I really can't complain about anything else.  I would definitely give this place another chance because if you can love it even after eating cold steak, it must be good."
4,"A rare authentic gem in Phoenix. This is the best french bakery / bistro in the Valley. The owner is from Lyon and has been here with his family for 10 years or so. His french pastry chef is extraordinary. Very unique find - imported directly from France as well. He's probably 80 and has prefected so many of his recipes. All of the pastries here are truly awesome.\n\nI haven't eaten here for lunch. But, the after dinner or before movie treats here are very good."
2,"First time in..I'm told they opened last Friday.. doing the research now.. more to come. ...\n\nFollow up :) \n\nSo a friend and I had some drinks, we ate some food.. having not been open long, they were already out of 'signature' items like the pretzels.. so we opted for the potato chip nachos, cheese-steak, and French dip. Nothing bad, nothing great about any one of them. \n\nNachos were good, a little light on the toppings, but tasty. The French dip and the cheese steak were both good and came with fries or cole slaw.\n\nThe service was good, and friendly, and that alone would make me go back. \n\nOtherwise, it's loaded with tv's beer, grub, and drinks.. should do well on the linq. \n\nHappy Eating!"
3,"One of my new favourite shawarma places (and places I get most excited for when visiting Montreal).  The shawarma meat is very well seasoned and tender.  They get it absolutely spot on.  The sides are quite good too.  We came here once with a large group and the owner came out and greeted us and gave us complimentary dates, which was very nice.\nDon't know if it was an accident, but the last time I went, there was very little meat on my plate, which was a disappointment."
3,"Leider musste der Starbucks oben auf dem Tower weichen. Evtl. zu Gunsten eines weiteren \""Fahrgesch\u00e4ftes\"".\n\n\n Der Starbucks auf dem Casino-Level existiert aber noch.\nEin Starbucks wie jeder andere in den Staaten. Hier jedoch erschien mir das Personal etwas pfiffiger als in vielen anderen Starbucksfilialen. Und leider kann man bei der Kaffeezubereitung doch Fehler begehen. Diesbez\u00fcglich durfte ich erhebliche Qualit\u00e4tsunterschiede in den USA feststellen.\nBei meinem heutigen Besuch gab es an der Kaffeezubereitung in diesem Store nichts zu bem\u00e4ngeln."
3,"Great day spa with great massages.  Highly recommended.  Try the double massage, fantastic."
2,"Food is nothing to brag about, in fact it is over priced. I have been in there a couple of times and always feel like we are a bother to the staff, as if we don't belong."
2,"Food was fantastic! It was SO loud I felt like i was screaming during dinner...didn't completely ruin it but I am undecided if I would go back. Keeping in mind, it was 7:30pm, not 10:00pm. A bit disappointing."
2,18 dollars for 4 meatballs is not a great deal! The food is ok. But I think this place is over priced. Ambience is not that great either.
0,This place is disgusting. I think I may have had the worse restaurant food in my life today.
0,"The establishment opens at 5:00 PM, I get there at 5:20ish and the lady at the booth says \""We are closed for a private event\"" and then asked me to come back at 7:00 PM. Honestly, no point in rating this any higher as they didn't bother reserving open seats for general people. \n\nThey didn't even bother changing the giant sign on their podium that said \""Opens at 5:00 PM\"""
3,Come for the happy hour! This place has got to be the BEST place to bring a first date.
3,"Got in for free while registered for the posing audition, so no complain.\nI posed today!\n\nPS: Get a brazilian wax if you plan to pose nude. See my list where I get it done in Northern California."
1,"Good effort, but a fail in my mind.  It is definitely WAY too loud in there... if I can't have a conversation while yelling... not a spot for me.  Tried the dumplings, burgers and coconuts... and found the price to be fairly high for mediocre 'street' food.  I think the only thing I would be back for is to pick-up some Beard Papas cream puffs."
0,"Well, after reading all the great reviews and hearing a lot about this place, I was so excited to eat here for lunch yesterday! I got chili cheese fries, and a plain ole' hotdog. My daughter got an order of the chicken nuggets. I wasn't really impressed by any of the food I had ordered. I'm really picky about my hotdogs and I was kind of grossed out by how thick they were. I'm used to the dodger dog styled ones, not Chicago style. That turned me off for the rest of my meal. My bun was really soggy and my hot dog kept falling out of it and that just pissed me off. The chili fries were also really runny. Not sure if they make their own chili but it was defiantly too runny for my liking. And last but not least, my daughters chicken nuggets tasted like a bucket of salt was dumped all over them. And don't get me wrong, I put salt on everything, I LOVE salt, but even that amount of salt was too much for me! I just really wasn't impressed by this place. Ill be sticking to wienershnitzle"
4,"This place is not only inspiration for custom baby photo books, but the ultra sound room is soothing and lovely! Spacious room with large flat screen for viewing. Terry the owner does an amazing job at the sneak peeks. Pictures are instant as well as online uploads, makes for simple sharing with family and friends."
3,"I came here for a friends benefit for his son.  No more details need to be explained but it was for a great cause.  This place opened its doors, offered its people and singers/bands performed.  For the cause, I am glad I came and saw this place.  I have never been to the arts district for a nighttime experience/bars!  \n\nIt was hard to find because the link to the yelp map does take you to the wrong location.  Once getting to the right location it is pretty much on the down low the lighting in the sign only light half of the sign and there are no signs around the door.  Little shady looking, but after walking in wow.  Nicely decorated in hip decor lighting is awesome for the nighttime experience and the staff is nice.  \n\nPrices are middle ground and the acoustics are good even though we were sitting on the other side of the bar from the bands.\n\nDefinitely a do over!"
2,"Meh.  Aside from people crowding around your car to \""hand wash\"" it, it's a pretty average car wash. \n\nThey'll probably get more gunk off your car than a machine or touchless wash, but there will be huge risk of scratches and \""spiderwebbing\"" because they use the dirtiest wash mitts I've ever seen. \n\nIf you love your paint, hand wash it yourself or use a touchless wash. \n\nIf you dont't care too much and don't like washing your own car take it here."
0,"Was quoted a price of $150.00 to fix a speeding ticket and paid it in full.  Weeks later received a letter stating that I owed an additional $145.00.  Ticket was $255.00 so I saved a total of $5.00.  Total misrepresentation, you can't quote one price and then weeks later send another bill paid directly to the court.  Woman in office Aurora lied through her teeth about the cost and when questioned after the fact said that the original $150.00 paid for the scaled Lawyer to go to court for you.  While there were no points or traffic school on the account, the additional money paid to the court should have been quoted up front instead of letting people \""assume\"" it was the final cost.  Total bullshit.  Don't use this crook."
4,"Best place to get your beauty products, hands down. Everyone is friendly and helpful without being pushy. They have great deals if you sign up for their mailing list...sometimes they send cards in the mail with vouchers for a FREE full size product with any purchase. They have special ladies night out events with raffle prizes, and discounts on salon services. I have never left empty handed or without a smile on my face.\n\nFYI, they take ULTA coupons too!!! and you can stack them with your beauty brands take ten!!"

0,"I live in the neighborhood and really wanted to like the Grind.  After 3 visits, I'm done.\nOverview: Food is mediocre service has stayed consistently terrible.\n\nMy last visit was happy hour with my 3 co-workers.  I had suggested we try the place and we arrived by 5 to make sure we got a table before rush hour.  \nAfter waiting to be served for about 10 min., the waitress finally spotted us & got our drink order.  We waited another 10 min. to get the drinks even though they were not yet busy.  We asked to order dinner and she said she'd be right back.  15 min. later she came to get our order.  We had an appetizer and 4 burgers.  Appetizer came out with the burger with no apologies.\nAfter we received the food our server disappeared, so condiments and drink refills were ordered from other staff.  When she returned she interrupted our conversation to ask if we were done.  From this point on she returned to the table with the check (not asking about dessert or more drinks) every 5 min. to ask if we were done.\nFinally, she came by and leaned in to tell us that \""it's getting really busy in here and there are people waiting for a table.  I'm not asking you to go but just so you know.\""  Are you kidding me?! We had ordered an appetizer, 4 entrees, 2 drinks each, & wanted dessert but she needed our table! \nUnreal. I will not return."
0,"I've been here 6 or 7 times and at first fell in love with their carne asada burrito. This love was short lived as every time I take my first bite the wrap completely apart due to the pico sauce water. Here's where the 1 star comes in. Service leaves a LOTTT to be desired. EVERY time I've ordered the same thing, and every time it takes 1/2 hour on average for the burrito to reach my table. There are 2 people eating inside the restaurant and 1 in the patio area - it shouldn't take this long. My coworker always gets a bean burrito with no cheese and EVERY time they've messed up the order and had to re-make it leaving us eating at different times. 3 weeks ago we were eating here and the Sheriff's department shut it down because of illegal immigration. Took 2 weeks for them to open up shop again. Unfortunately this has had a worse effect on the service (at least it seems as though this is the case) because not only did my burrito come out 1/2 hour later, but as I finally got up the courage to complain, the manager gave us all kinds of excuses and no apologies. I guess I'd still eat their food if it was take out but other than that, I don't think I'll be coming back to America's taco shop anymore. Good Luck guys!!"
4,"Great location, you can bike right up too it...lawn is awesome and well layed out.  Bathrooms and concessions are right there."
1,"Rather disappointed in this place actually. Food was good, not amazing , but good. But portion size , topped with poor service made it a place we'll skip when picking a quick dinner out. I don't get their menu. Food and sides don't go together really, and the whole thing just doesn't make sense to me. When we were ordering, it seemed as if we were bothering her, which was slightly awkward. Overall, not a good experience. Cool name, but not relative to the food at all. I'd say skip this place."
3,"Went Christmas shopping here this week and it had everything I need. Conveniently had all the frames I was looking for, in stock, and was able to get photo albums, stockings, and santa hats all in one place. Being located in Tempe Marketplace helps too. I will definitely be back to this location. \n\nBeware that parking is somewhat had to find during the holidays."
1,"Slow service. A lot of people who were waiting before us left cause they were so slow, AND there were empty tables. Got seated and waited a good 30 min for our food.\n\nBurgers were good, I got the oxtail chili cheese fries. So not worth it, barely any oxtail, it was more like beans, cheese, and fries. Overall, stick to the burgers."
3,Great food and wonderful service. Here during breakfast hour. I will be back.
0,"Well, I randomly came across this Noodle shop as I was wondering around into the Caesar's Palace, which is like a rat maze that is designed to never let you out. I was told that Caesar's Palace has one of the big cocktail drinks that everyone seemed to be carrying around in the street and there I got stuck in search of the damn drink. I started to get hungry and came across a bright white restaurant with ridiculous gold fish tanks. I was told that they hand roll their noodles and make their dumplings, so I convinced our party to stop by for lunch. Oof. Big mistake! We ordered the Beijing noodles, seafood noodle soup, Shanghai dumplings, and kungpao shrimp. All of them were complete misses. I am not sure if it was just us, but we completely failed on all our dishes. It might have been just a coincidence, but I think not. I think this place just sucks. It is overpriced for such a noodle shop and I have been lured in by the damn fish tanks. Damn it! And for those reviewers who gave 5 stars, what the hell did you eat? And what have you eaten all your life? Dog food?"
3,"Ate here twice on a 3 day visit. \nExcellent, charbroiled burger. I had the Tex-Mex, twice. Perfect both times. Pricey? I disagree, though I live in a resort town. Money and time well spent. Service was great and they seemed to enjoy what they were doing. And clean.\nYou won't regret it except if your a vegan.........."
0,"Not impressed at all. Thought they would have a better selection of food with the price  that you pay. I was really upset that we got charged a mandatory gratuity fee because a family member was seated next to us. The waitress asked if we knew her and when we said yes, the waitress automatically insisted that we pay this mandatory gratuity. I mean doesn't she have to wait on the other tables surrounding us? It made no sense and she wouldn't or couldn't explain the theory behind it. After paying this \"" mandatory gratuity\"" we couldn't enjoy our dinner and decide to leave. I was really looking forward to the Wicked Spoon but unfortunately with the experience we had, it just didn't happen."
4,"even though i live roughly 15-20 minutes from this store, i still make it a weekly habit to come here for groceries. \n\nthe breakdown: \n\nsushi. their selection of rolls and sashimi are awesome! i love that i can buy a brick sized piece of salmon sashimi to take home and slice up myself. while i do love aj's sushi bar as well, whole foods definitely has them beat. \n\njuice bar. whenever i come in to do my shopping, i always head straight to the juice bar for one of their delicious fresh drinks. every juice mix i've tried has been fantastic, even if the fruit/veggie combo sounded like it might not work together.\n\nproduce. really terrific selection of fruits and vegetables. i especially love their huge variety of pre-cut produce; it makes cooking super convenient!\n\nin addition to carrying a lot of great companies that i can't get at any other local stores, their stuff is generally totally affordable.  a grocery store with a unique selection can mean higher prices (aj's), but i usually leave whole foods feeling pretty pleased with what i ended up spending. \n\nps. i'm super pumped for the new store that's opening on camelback next month! now i'll have a store within a mile of my house!"
0,"Terrible service at a recent visit.  It was a Monday around 7ish and my co-worker and I walked in to this place.  We didn't have a reservation as we just flew in to town.  But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \""oh did you want to just eat out here?\"".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \""crowd\""?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.  This is now on my must-avoid and do-not-recommend list."
3,"What better way to celebrate my 29th birthday than to try to live it up like I was turning 21? There are many reasons why I don't frequent these \""ultra high-end\"" nightclubs anymore, but I guess it was my lucky day. This was the first time I was on a guestlist with comp tickets and actually got in for free. No cover for a guy in Vegas? Unheard of. There was also no wait in the guestlist line. Dada Life was the headliner. \n\nPros: Aesthetics-wise, this nightclub is just as nice as any other. There's a nice lounge with benches for sitting without having to get bottle service. There's three different levels and plenty of space, except the main stage. \n\nCons: Stairs - apparently these are death for the ladies. There's no outdoor patio/pool area so it can get stuffy, but there's cool jets that blast the crowd every once in a while. Confetti is dropped every now and then, but the pieces stain your skin, especially the blue ones! The cost of a drink is ridiculous - a Red Bull/vodka was $25. So much cigarette and cigar smoke in an indoor setting.\n\nMark Eteson was the opener for Dada Life and was the only person I saw since apparently I'm old now and I can't make it to 2 am anymore. Still, I can say I had fun on my birthday at a Vegas club!"
4,"This place is awesome. Tasty burgers and fresh cut steak fries. Tons of options from the classic burger toppings, to saut\u00e9ed garlic and pesto! You can also get fried eggs or even pastrami!\n\nThe feel is super chill and great music. Sherl, the owner is super cool, and always helpful for first-timers.\n\nThirsty? How about one of the 16 flavors of lemonade?! I've been searching for the best burger in Phoenix, and this is up there with the chuckbox near ASU, Ted's in Cave Creek and Lucky Boy as far as a \""great burger\"" goes!"
3,"A star was taken away for service and price.  Yes it is more food and better quality than your standard hibachi restaurant but the price is pretty ridiculous in comparison.  The server had to argue about doom alcohol on separate receipt since we were using a gov't credit card.  Don't get the sushi since it is way overpriced and not comparable to a sushi restaurant.  Unlike other Beni's this one does not offer a full sushi lineup, probably b/c there is a sushi bar next door."
2,"It's a must see if you are visiting the west rim. But yes, it is a rip off. It's $80 to visit the site and walk on the skywalk. What makes this a really bad deal is the idea that you cannot even bring a camera/phone on the skywalk. The excuse that you might drop it in the canyon or on the glass is just another way for them to justify making money off of you by taking pictures for you and selling them to you. Seriously, why would anyone throw their couple hundred dollars phones/cameras away? The walk is a one time visit and will not get a second visit from me, for sure. However, if you've never seen it, you should go take a look."
2,"I'd give them high marks for execution.  Everything was cooked properly, served promptly and efficiently.  Not a lot of creativity or soul beyond the menu preparation.  Typical for the Vegas high end joints that cater to people on business.  Like everything on The Strip prices are astronomical - I will never forgive a restaurant that charges $125 for a bottle of wine I can get for $25.\n\nThe hostesses seated everyone close together so it became very noisy even though the restaurant was half-empty.  No place charging these prices should make such mistakes. \n\nGreat place if you're on an expense account.  If it's your own money I would pick a different city."
1,"As with any buffet, you get what you pay for.  This place is about $14 for dinner if I recall correctly.\n\nThe Mongolian grill section doesn't have much selection to choose from, but it's pretty yummy regardless.  The sushi is surprisingly good for buffet sushi.  Pot stickers are really good.  Pepper steak is excellent.  Orange chicken is decent.\n\nSo why only 2 stars?  Well, it's the tour groups.  The place is a madhouse when the tour groups come in.  It's just too crowded to find any sort of comfort.  Not to mention the people on the tour group are frequently rude and shove you and cut in line.  They used to only have tour groups on weekend nights.  They are there all the time now, even weekday lunches.  Not to be racist, but there is a cultural difference that I just can't wrap my head around.  I don't understand visiting a foreign country and eating a bastardized version of food from your homeland."
4,"I loved Kokomo! I have yet to go to a fro yo store as clean as Kokomo! The fruits were so fresh, and the topping section was clean, with a great variety! I also found it charming that I got to meet with the friendly owners! Kokomo beats all the yogurt store in this area!  I didn't feel guilty because the yogurt is so healthy! I highly recommend Kokomo!"
2,"The Chandler location is located in a strip mall.  Strike one.\nThe decoration of the Chandler location looks very ...80's? Strike two. (  I don't know how to describe it.  The Havana Cafe's Chandler location just doesn't look modern or even retro; the interior just looked outdated.)\n\nThey got on base with the food.  We ordered \""Tostones\"", which are twice fried plantains with a mojo garlic sauce and an order of Empanaditas for the appetizers for four of us.    Both were satisfying.\n\nFor dinner, I ordered Pollo Cubano, chicken breast in light curry, lime, and garlic with sauteed sweet onions on top.   The winner at the table was the Gallina Frita, shredded chicken breast, pan fried with onions laced with a garlic sauce.   Can't decide from all the choices that sound good on the menu?  Do as my husband did and order the Dinner Sampler and try a variety.   At the end, we were too stuffed to try desert.  (Well, for the record, everyone else was too stuffed.  I would have been game to try something, but I didn't want to look like a pig :)\n\nI thought the food was good, but a overpriced for the meal.  Our service was spot on and attentative, but as the other reviews seemed to indicate, and our friends feedback validated, the service can be spotty.\n\nI say - try the place out.  We would definately go back."
1,"Irksome gimmicky pub atmosphere, like a classier Bennigan's."
0,Tried this place twice and both times service was very slow and food was overpriced for what we got. Staff (including management) not very friendly or helpful. It's a shame bc I enjoy staying at this hotel.
2,"Couple things on most recent visit-\nCalamari was surprisingly good\nWaitstaff still act in a haphazard manner, had 3 different waiters during night. Some of the younger ones went into back room and I speculate were drinking. I mean whatever but its a sign this place is possibly headed downhill\nMy steak ordered medium came out darn near rare and then after a heat up came back leather\nFinally, the bull that was out on Sahara is now in the backroom as some truck hit the pole it was on and knocked it off! A bit odd this long time iconic sign is gone and doesn't seem they will be putting it back up. Yet another sign this spot is not being run at a high end professional level."
0,"Picked this based on the two reviews. Its been 45 minutes since we saw our server. No appetizers yet. There are two servers and six tables. We have watched two orders go back to the chef, worried about our food. Food came, recommend burgers or sandwiches."
4,"Great food, good selection of veg curries at buffet (choose from 6).\n\nFresh and tasty garlic naan.\n\nTastefully done interiors and decor.\n\nClean bathroom with diaper changing station.\n\nOur little one was sleeping, she woke up 10 mins before 3 pm (close) and they accommodated us for 15 mins after close while she ate."
3,"This place has a pool with a clear floor. AMAZING. You can see straight down to the... parking entrance. Hilarious. The pool is pretty tiny - entirely for relaxing, no exercise here. \n\nThe usual Westin bed, Westin service (even for we F1 fans, not staff) were excellent.    Mandatory valet parking with excellently quick service and attentive desk staff. Pristine bathrooms and arranged essentials."
4,"So my layover in Phoenix was three hours long (turned into six but that's a whole 'nother story...) Anyways, my cousin goes to ASU, so I called her up and had her get me for breakfast since I had a ton of time to kill.\n\nShe takes me to this little tiny place called Over Easy. Yay, it looks cute. It also looks like (by looking at the building) it used to be a Taco Bell back in the day. Ah oh!\n\nWHO KNEW THERE WAS GOOD FOOD IN ARIZONA!? I actually liked the 'Over Easy' entree that I got. Filled me up and while it wasn't gourmet or anything, it was the next best thing. Also, it's helpful to mention that there is nothing on the menu over 10.00 - nothing. All you ASU kids should eat here.\n\nFinally, the crappy thing about running a business in the middle of an Arizona desert is that you're sometimes gonna get some Arizona desert clientele. Let me just say that the service is amazing. EVEN THOUGH there were some genuine straight from the trailer park douchebags in there. Had to say it. I love you Over Easy."
2,"Aria is a relatively new and nice hotel. The staffs are friendly. The casino is very straight forward and organized. I love how Jean Philippe is by the guest rooms so very convenient for breakfast, snack and coffee. \n\nThe guest rooms hallway is super confusing. It was never-ending and it criss-cross at some point...imagine finding your room if you're drunk. \n\nThe room is nice. I like how it's pretty automatic with the window and \""service\"" and \""private\"" button and all. I like how the shower is connected to the tub. Thre room is pretty clean and spacious.\n\nThe pool is nice along with three jacuzzi. I like how you don't have to walk through the casino to get to the pool. You just have to go to the promenade floor. But it's weird, it seems like the pool is open to anyone public and not just hotel guess. \n\n I like how they have a tram that's connected to Bellagio and Crystals. The Cosmopolitan is also just few minute walks away. It's super convenient!! Will definitely like to stay there again."
4,"I just recently discovered Aerial Yoga from a friend and I'm totally addicted!!!  Altitude Aerials has a Aerial Yoga class on Saturday and Sunday and not only is it an amazing workout, and fun to do, but it's affordable too!\n\nMy review is based only on the Aerial Yoga classes... I haven't been to any of their Aerial shows or training yet but I do plan on it!"
0,"Being in the restaurant business I understand times are tough. Any type of promotion to bring in guests that is feasible would give the \""edge\"" to a particular business. Frequenting this particular applebees I felt like I just walked into club applebees. The volume is way over the top. Service was compatible to a crowded bar with one bartender to serve. I sat at a table to wait 10 minutes before even being greeted by my server. With the music it came as no sunrise that the food order came out totally incorrect. After trying to stomach through the wrongly prepared item, I had to regrettably send it back. After 2 minutes it came back corrected with the quality parallel to Taco Bell. The identity is in question, the food is a pathetic excuse for a full service franchise, and service that I could find in a dive bar. Highly disappointed in this franchise as of late. Past three visits to different area locations have ended in similar fashion. So sad."
4,5 star worthy. I'd give it 6 stars if Yelp would let me. It's all about the hot signature sandwiches here. All sandwiches are made to order making them fresh out of the oven. Fresh ingredients (make sure to add bacon)  served up on a nicely toasted Artisan baked loaf and topped with unique sauces and spreads. Try the Chipotle Chicken Avocado and the Caribbean Jerk Chicken (my favorites!)
0,"Came here for dinner. Quick seating and low price $20.\nThe atmosphere feels very old-medieval-esque. To my taste, too dull and quiet. Not too many young people either. Mainly middle-aged and on, or small families.\nMy waitress wasn't responsive. Once we had our order of drinks, that was it, she never returned.\nThe food selection is mediocre. Most of the chefs don't smile and seem to growl every time you request something.\nThere's a Mongolian section where you select your vegetables and your meat option. The chef makes the plate of food for you within 5 minutes. But, the leftover food bits from the previous order(s) weren't fully scraped off. Had little black bits throughout my plate. Hate to waste food, but definitely not risking my stomach.\nBest choice for me was the porkchops. Soft and tasty. Everything else, meh. Even the desserts weren't to par.\nVery disappointed."
4,"I'm practically at this spot everyday. I often wonder why people still drink the burned tar that is Starbucks. I love this location because the staff is amazing- Todd and Kevin are the best (we love Limor on the weekends). I'm so glad to see Caribou offer different tea lattes. Love it. They offer so many more options than just coffee- and the prices are reasonable....and not too mention you're not bombarded by buying knick nacks and CD's. The Mocha Latte is excellent and my husband usually goes for the Mint Condition- they offer 3 different choices of chocolates in your beverage (if it calls for it), which is a nice added option. You can mix up different beverages and flavors and I love the different flavors you can get around the holidays as well. Check it out. Drop Starbucks."
3,"I never have any complaints about this location whenever I come by. This is a recommended place to get pho if you're in the area. \n\nI hardly ever deviate from getting pho when I go to a pho place, but the few times I have had rice dishes here, I haven't been disappointed. I personally am a fan of broken rice because I like the small grains, I find them easier to chew and more enjoyable. The pork and chicken are cooked fairly well with a good amount of flavor in each bite. The pho itself is nothing too out of the ordinary. The noodles are good, the meat is good, the broth is good, what more do you want?\n\nThe restaurant itself feels very clean and orderly. Like at Pho So 1, the food there is good as well, but everything always feels so disorderly and it just feels like it could be a bit cleaner, Jenni Pho doesn't have that problem. \n\nI'm not loyal to any pho place in Las Vegas, but Jenni Pho is definitely added to the pool of pho places in the city."
2,"An okay bakery, but is it a five star lunch spot? No. True to its confectionary specialties, the food here is sweet- and I mean everything is sweet. The sticky sweet croissants, the salads that are peppered with honey and candied nuts, the pita sandwiches that are oddly stuffed with whole oranges (pith and all) and sweet pickle, even the simple vegetable soup that overwhelmingly tasted like sweet potatoes and allspice- absolutely every dish served to us here incorporated fruits or honey, transmogrifying a savory lunch into a toothache inducing sugar fest. I can understand how the sweet-savory thing can appeal to some people (like, I don't know, pre-diabetics and your typical Waldorf salad eating American sugar addict), but I can't stand it. The staff is extremely friendly and well-acquainted with their sacrosanct Yelp referrals; in fact, they're almost too friendly... like guilt you into writing a good review for some free baklava friendly. Further, to my understanding, the only thing organic here is the wheat flour they use in their breads- big deal? Nothing that I love about Mediterranean food came through here - the sumac, the pungent garlic, the lamb, the kebabs, the fresh roasted vegetables... you won't find any of it here. Overall, an average bakery (the baklava and pinwheels were good- but I'm not orgasmic over them), but lunch? Eh..."
0,"The owner runs this joint with an iron fist and if you cross paths with him you'll feel like you in a North Korean labor camp :) It is fun to watch him on small doses\nThe place is nice and clean and above all you feel safe inside ..\nWifi is pretty solid also\n\nupdate, I've been here on few other occasions to wash my bed stuff and homeless are always around some wash in the bathroom and while the owner chases them away its not safe .. i will find a better one for the future"
3,"IT WOULD'VE BEEN 5 STARS BUT THE WAITRESS WAS BITCHY AT FIRST!\n\nBeing a HUGE Sex and The City fan, I had to go to this place.  The decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  Red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nOur visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nThe menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.\n\nI loved this place.  With the exception of the servers lack of time management skills at first, this was one of my favorite visits on this trip.  I WILL BE GOING BACK!  I LOVE SUSHI SAMBA!!!!!!!"
2,"The Skinny: great customer service when booking by phone (5!) but a show that lacks spectacle and story (3).\n\nOkay, the travelzoo promotion site was down so I had to call the reservation line to book tickets for La Reve this weekend. Expecting to wait on the line for at least 2-3 minutes, I'd settled down with a cup of tea, a book and comfy slippers.\n\nTo my surprise, the phone was answered in less than a minute. I'm not even sure I heard the dialtone! The lady on the line was super friendly and took my order for 3 tickets right away. We started chatting about Vegas and I mentioned that I was a local.\n\n\""A local? Let me look and see if the locals deal can apply to your tickets for you.\"" Say what? \""Okay, it looks like the locals deal is better for you. Let me go ahead and apply that discount.\"" But I looked online and there wasn't a locals deal advertised currently. \""Sometimes we don't advertise about the local deal but the promotion is ongoing.\"" Sweet! How's that for excellent customer service? That is 5-star service folks!\n\nNow on to the actual performance.\n\nLe Reve is definitely a dream... like as in the what-the-hell-is-going-on-here kind of nightmare. At its essence, the show lacked that one key thread that holds everything together - a storyline.\n\nIt starts off with this girl in white with her boyfriend who sits on a park bench which becomes immersed in water. Then the girl is dressed in red. Let the odd dreams sequences with all these bald dudes begin!\n\nReally, the best parts of the show were the clowns. They literally stole the show and ought to have a larger role throughout the piece. They seemed to be the only ones during the show that actually were trying to tell the audience something. \n\nThere is a lot of dancing/synchronized swimming so don't expect many acrobatic feats during this production. Not to mention the majority of the acrobatic feats are aerial in nature. So if you don't like aerialists or dancers, don't go to this show!\n\nTo be honest with you, I think that the acrobats/dancers must work their patootie off for this production because they definitely perform numerous roles within the show. However it's a major flaw that these obviously talented, versatile people don't get their moment to shine. During the show, there's so many things going on all at once, the actual performance of the individuals gets lost in the frey. It's a too much sensory overload and it shows.\n\nAlthough some of the sequences were quite beautiful, they lack cohesiveness and personality to make this a truly great show. For that, this show gets a 3 starred review."
3,"I love Korean BBQ and this place won't disappoint you. their food is very tasty and they offer different options for everyone. we ordered a \""combo\"" for two which included a soda or rice alcohol drink (kind of strong) and 3 different types of meats.  They are also open extended hours. \nservice: Fair\nprep time: 8 Min\natmosphere:  relaxing, good place to enjoy with a group of friends\nBest Thing: at the end of your BBQ meal you can enjoy some fried rice.\nworst thing: they do not offer a lot of the small sides that other Korean restaurants have\nPrice: one of the best prices in town"
3,"Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las Vegas and far, far away from any parking, the Auld Dubliner is still one of the best Irish pubs in town.  Pretty much because the bar understands that a pub should be low key and classic.  In Ireland, a pub is just a run of the mill watering hole.  But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  \n\nNot the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   \n\nBut they also serve up a solid pub menu.  When we went, we had deep fried chips with curry (yum) and a couple of solid cheese burgers topped with Irish cheddar cheese.  The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.\n\nI hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks."
1,"I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location, so they've got a good amount of prepared (or 'oven-ready') foods. It's close to my house.\n\nBut going here is ALWAYS such a nightmare.\n\nThe parking lot is miserable. There's a tiny lot area, and then an underground parking garage, but both are a pain to navigate and find a space in. I have never been here when there wasn't a long wait at the deli (and the deli order machine is always down, so you really have no choice but to wait in the line). The aisles feel more narrow than they should be for a store this size. \n\nThis store has a lot of potential, and it *is* the biggest GE in the immediate city area, but I always leave frazzled and anxious, so I'd rather just make the drive to the suburbs for my Giant Eagle shopping trip."
1,"I remember in elementary school I had a friend of mine who regaled me with wild stories of how excellent the buffet was at the Rio. Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.\n\nWhat I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.\n\nA few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.\n\nWe got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.\n\nSo, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity. And guess what? You'll still get a filling, delicious meal!"
4,Two type of services they offer... Full service (interior and exterior) and exterior washing.  First visit and impress with service. Car is extremely clean with a extra fee to clean bugs out for $5.00 which is fine with me.. Will definitely come back to get my car clean again.. Thanks guys for the awesome job..
1,"Goodness gracious...I needed some fro-yo and some hand picked toppings. Saw the Red Mango sign and damn...I was ready! \n\nNow, not all Red Mango's are not the same. I am use to my Red Mango where you get eight flavors to choose from, choose how much you want to put in your cup and pick your own toppings. No self serve here:( \n\nSo, I watched as the girl put more yogurt than I asked her to. I couldn't believe each topping was .75. I watched as she meticulously put each blackberry on one through six. Then she honored my request of mochi balls and dumped a spoonful on top. \n\n\nI guess I like the experience of getting exactly what I want, measuring it out myself, weighing it and paying for it. Yes, I know, I could have gone elsewhere but it's all good. \n\nRed Mango is some delicious fro-YO! Perfect stop to chill and cool off after being in the Vegas heat."
0,"This Starbucks is the worst I've been to. They don't get your name when you order (which I believe is company policy). They don't even say the name of the drink they put on the counter so it's essentially just best guess as to what drink belongs to who.   And don't ask the baristas, I believe they enjoy the confusion. I'm yet to get what I ordered and the white chocolate soy milk latte I took home last week was quite terrible.\nJust go somewhere else. It's truly not worth it."
2,"Happy hour is great here at this restaurant....However you can tell they are part of a big chain working to cut costs where they can.....We tried dinner there last night....The Filet was very dry for med rare ....I have had better on my own grill purchased from a local grocery.....The shrimp cocktail is supposed to be huge shrimp as an appetizer for $17.00 and these were quite small, .the kind you would find commonly anywhere. with no flavor...The single loaf of bread was cold and the outside of it was not crispy....The butter options were good though....My other half enjoyed the salmon and it was cooked perfectly...Overall for the price of dinner, I would not go back....HOWEVER I would do happy hour there again.....The happy hour menu is good and the prices are great.... I DO WANT TO SAY THE STAFF AND MANAGEMENT ARE IMPECCABLE....TRAINED WELL AND GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO INSURE YOUR EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST IT CAN BE....."
2,The food was decent so they lose a star there.  We tried the chicken which had good flavor but was a bit dry.  The BBQ sandwich was much the same.  The ribs were killer though.  And the insane amount of side they have is awesome.  All 4 sides we tried were really tasty.\n\nThey lose another star because we sat and watched person after person that ordered after us get their togo orders before they even bothered to tell us they messed up on our order.  Their saving grace was the gentleman that work the register there telling us he was sorry and gave us a free dish.\n\nI will try this place again hoping it was a fluke.
1,"It's a standard Super 8 two star. Clean enough, nothing fancy, and some funny smells here and there. Sirens outside throughout the night. The night clerk said a few things that didn't make sense and were confusing. The thin door to the next room let me hear the dude coughing all night. These are all pretty standard for this type of hotel, but all together I'd probably consider staying somewhere else if I had to stay another night."
3,We got a two room suite with a kitchenette. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is great. They have a full breakfast Buffett that is delicious. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They also have a shuttle that takes you right to the strip.
1,"What's up with this place ... it is not open during posted hours. Chairs are turned upside down on the tables, door locked, and an [Open] sign is still hung in window. I was there 8:00am (closed) Fri. 4/1 - posted hours 7:00am. I was there 9:00am (still closed) ... what's going on? Also have driven by in early afternoon, closed.\n\nTheir ad in the 4-2-11 Chandler Republic states:\n\nNow Open Melted Cheese Kitchen\n\nopen 7am to 3pm Monday - Saturday for Breakfast & Lunch\n\nwhat gives?\n\nI'm willing to spend money and the place is not open."
1,"Plus - cabby got me home in record time.  \n\nMinus - it wasn't without a fair amount of drama.  Driver was aggressive to anyone who was in his way or didn't move fast enough, slowing down to give dirty looks to anyone who displeased him.  When we arrived at Aria he almost got in a fight with a limo driver who he mean mugged for no reason.  You have a choice in this town.  i'll turn these guys down from now on.  These cabbies always complain there is not enough work.  Then when they get it, they do this?"
4,"Edinburgh castle has got to be the number one must see attraction within Edinburgh.  Due to the location of the castle, high on an extinct volcanic hill, it overlooks the entire city.  Almost anywhere in the city you can gaze up and see the castle.  It looks amazing in the morning fog and even more spectacular in the afternoon sun.\n\nThis is probably one of the largest castle compounds which I have toured as well.  The castle is quite well maintained and you can get stunning pictures both outside the city walls and within.\n\nOnce inside the castle there is a free guided tour which will walk you through the outside explaining all of the things to see in the castle.  I have been twice and enjoyed this part of the castle tour each time.  I recommend walking with this guided tour (it lasts about a half hour) and then independently exploring the different areas.  The crown jewels, the chapel, the dungeons, the war memorial and the WWI memorial with the top of the black volcanic mountain poking through the floor are probably my most favorite areas to explore.\n\nOn nice days and probably the weekends, the ticket line can be quite long however you can order online in advance or order from the hop on, hop off bus tours and walk straight through.  This saved us some time on our second trip to Edinburgh as our first trip, I spent about a half hour waiting."
3,"I was disappointed that they were not doing take out anymore, however, we came in today and i was extremely impressed with their food AND customer service. They really made the ordering process super easy."
1,"Not worth the money! Today was my step sons bday and his mother arranged a party here. The cost for the package was $240, and included pizza, soda, and decorations and a free round of laser tag and mini golf. We payed an extra $90 to add more kids because it only included 15. None of this bothered me til we got there and had to ask for cutlery,  they provided the cake,  but no cake cutter, no tokens for the kids to play games, the bathroom was disgusting. To top it all off, we were only given an hour and a half,  to eat, have cake, play games, and they were rushing us before we could even open gifts! Any person with kids knows it takes a lot longer to have a party, and for what we paid they should be able to not rush through this! Good news is the birthday boy had a blast, but we won't be returning,  too expensive and it's not worth it!!"
0,"This place had such good reviews so I was excited. And then very disappointed. The room itself was nice (If you ignore the dent in the wall by the bed and stain on the chair). And it was cool that we got to use the MGM pool (after walking a mile but that is just MGM in general.) But that is where my happiness stopped. This place is expensive and a high star-rated hotel- I expect excellent service because of it. I couldn't check in early (despite the fact that when I booked it they told me I could for a fee), fine- that's life I'll wait at the pool till check-in.  Then I had to wait in line to check my bags with the bell hop. Then at check-in I had to wait in another 30 min. line to check-in (if you are that full- have more people there to help!!) Then to continue my day full of waiting- I had to wait another 45 mins for the bell hop to bring my bags up to me while I sit in my wet bathing suit and wanting to shower but have nothing to change into.  The valet took about 20 mins to get my car, and they clearly parked it in the hot sun not in a garage, because it was hot when we got it. I didn't get the promised VIP tickets to the clubs I was supposed to receive. I didn't get the corner room I was promised at the desk. And the employees were all very snickety instead of polite and helpful. When spending money at a luxury hotel, I expect luxury results. I will not be staying here ever again."
4,"OMG! This place is awesome...my husband and I were visiting Vegas for work and wanted to eat some good sushi and based on the reviews here, we decided to check this place out...the service was amazing top notch.. Really. I never went to an all you can eat sushi and chefs and waitresses tell you to try everything and this and that... I first thought those items are extra charge since they were asking constantly. But, man this place is great... The fish, the dishes were fresh and tasty... Everyone was so friendly and fun.. Definitely coming back the next time..."
4,"First let me start off by saying what a wonderful experience my furniture shopping turned out to be! My wife and I moved into our new house and realized we had no furniture to full our 1800 sqft, so we went on down to walker and were greeted but not pestered by many sales people who were eager to ensure we were finding everything to our satisfaction. The sales person whom we actually felt with was a really awesome guy named Richard (I recommend him to anyone reading this), Richard found on standing puzzled near a really huge king size bed set that both my wife and I really liked, we were puzzled because we didn't know how the pricing worked if we wanted to buy only certain pieces rather than the entire set. Richard was very helpful and even got us a 20% discount on an already on sale item and this really surprised my wife and I :) the experience for my wife and I was almost like just running into a friend who also sold furniture becsuse Richard made us really feel at ease so much so that we even invited him to my wife's bday which was the following weekend! The furniture was delivered on time and exactly as promised and we are very very satisfied with our Walker furniture experience and see no other reason to shop anywhere else in the future :) on a side note our sales person didn't make it out to the wife's bday but the following weekend we did get a very thoughtful bday card and a $25 gift card to century theaters as a thank you/happy birthday, I call that a great customer experience!  Thanks Richard and Walker."
3,"Cupcake Heaven!!  Well... only because I haven't physically been to Yummy Cupcakes in LA - so a direct comparison is still pending.  So, a 5-star update may be in the future.\n\nHere at Mad Hatter you can actually custom build your own 4 layer cupcakes! ... Observe\n\nFirst, you start off with the type of cake.  Choose from flavors such as classic chocolate, vanilla bean, red velvet and several others.\n\nThen you choose what type of oooey-gooey filling you want in it.   Chocolate Ganache, White chocolate Ganace, Banana creme, Orange creme, etc etc etc ,there are literally over a dozen choices.\n\nNext comes the topping ... More Chocolate?  More Vanilla? More White Chocolate? Cream Chees perhaps? Ahhhhhh the Choices !!\n\nWhat??? One more choice??!?. Pick a Topper!  A Bite Sized Butterfinger? Baby Ruth? Snickers? Kit Kat? Twix? Chocolate chip cookie?  A C-3PO HEAD??! yes, you can so choose that if you wish.\n\nCupcakes are $3.25each and can also be bought in Half Dozens($19.50) and Dozens($36.00).\n\nConveniently located just a stone's throw away from Cupcake Lane at the Target Plaza on Ft Apache/215, so we were able to make a direct comparison.\n\nAt Mad Hatter, I went for the Red Velvet, with Orange Creme filling and White Chocolate creme topping\n\nI Then went next door to Cupcake lane for their Red Velvet with cream cheese topping.....sadly, it was no contest.   Mad Hatter wins that comparison, hands-down.  Maybe it's not a fair comparison... after all, I custom made the cupcake at Mad Hatter. \n\nBut, no worries.  There will be further direct comparisons in the future"
1,"Ich finde die Atmosph\u00e4re ganz gut, es ist viel Platz und das Personal war nett. \n\nDas Essen war sehr sehr sehr fettig. In dem Moment war es ganz ok, aber im Nachgang widersteht es mir total."
3,"Came here on a Saturday night with my man friend and were pleasantly surprised at the emptiness of the restaurant.. ( I really hate waiting.. who doesn't?) Any who.. we already knew what we wanted to get before coming here.. \n\nKaraage _ Like everyone has already said.. It is delish!!! Crispy but not oily~ good portion too~!\n\nFukumimi ramen_ i asked to add some garlic oil to it but I don't know if that even made a difference. I thought it was pretty tasty.. Pretty rich but not TOO porky.. and not overly salty like Monta's ... & Noodles were cooked perfectly.\n\nTan Tan Men_ It was my first time trying this dish and I thought it was pretty good.. It had some sort of deep nutty flavor to it.. I don't really like nuts that much LOL so i was good just stealing a couple bites from my bf~ \n\nKimchi_ my BF really liked their kimchi haha it is more of the fresher variety so it didn't have that fermented sour taste that I like.. \n\nNice waitresses & chefs, fast service! Check it out if you're in the area ;]]]"
2,Great atmosphere. Friendly staff. I got the falafel-the pita was very good but the actually falafel balls were very dry.
3,"this stores great for both foods, daily needs and customer service! I only went in there for a few minutes but dealt with about 3 different people and all were absolutely great. everyone is so friendly and easy going.\n\nplus they sell hcg1234.\n\nim just sayin... =)"
2,"I enjoyed a nice spring day in Scottsdale at the patio of Stingray Sushi.  I have to say the ambiance of the restaurant fit well with the feeling I had that day.  The unagi and tuna sashimis were excellent.  The one problem I had is that the entire time our waitress didn't realize that we didn't have the little dipping square for our soy sauce and wasabi.  I was waiting the entire time to see if they would notice, but I let it go and compensated by using my plate for my soy sauce.  I didn't really care, but I was curious to see if they would even notice or offer it.  It wasn't even a busy service, so I give a star less than I would normally give for lack of attention."
4,"I used to take my Civic to Honda for everything that needed to be done. I am so glad that Mori is my go to guy since then, my family also brings their cars to have him fix them. He is honest and his work is perfect. His prices are much more realistic than the dealership. You will save more money by going to Mori at this shop. You will have it fixed in a timely manner too. Even for major work. Thumbs up to this shop and to Mori."
1,"Sister and I were hungry at 10 PM on a Sunday night and were looking for some Mexican delight. Pepe's Tacos had recently opened up near our house and we decided to get down.\n\nI ordered three tacos: carne asada, lengua, and al pastor. The lengua and the carne asada were decent. Not horrible, but not stand out. The star of my taco trio was the al pastor. The marinated pork, cilantro, onion, a squeeze of lime, a touch of the hot sauce. AMAZING! Definitely a must try. \n\nMy sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it. Didn't really pack much of a punch. The rice and beans were okay as well.\n\nPepe's is open 24 hours and has a wide variety of offerings that are all cooked to order. They have a traditional taco salsa bar, with the red hot spicy sauce of death (which I love) and a green, mild salsa. The carrot, onion, jalapeno mix. Radishes. \n\nThis location was clean, brightly lit. The staff was friendly. Pepe's is a decent taco shop. A step up from Roberto's, but not a home run."
1,"Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. \n\nRamen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. \n\nBroth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. \n\nBroth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.\n\nChashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. \n\nTamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.\n\nAlcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)\n\nService: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem \n \nParking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. \n\nWait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly"
3,"It's been over a year since I was here and promised to leave a review. Why wait that long?  \n\nOne benefit is that I can say that the work done has stood the test of time and other than the title it would be hard for someone not very well versed in used cars to tell it was ever in an accident. \n\nThe process of working with LG was very good with  some phone tag, but not excessively so. There were complications from the kind of accident it was and insurance companies involvment that caused delays  plus the difficulty of getting parts from Japan at the time made it hard to get a handle on how long it would take for me to rent a car for.   In the end they helped me out on the deductible as their site says and a few days car rental so It was fair. \n\n I'd be more than happy to take a car back here should the need arise and I'm pretty sure you'll be  in the 4-5 star range when you do.    For me 4.5"
0,Ridiculous way to run a business. TERRIBLE phone service (even the employees comment on how poor it is) with RIDICULOUS hold times (in excess of 15 minutes EVERY TIME). To see the SAME specialist for the SAME condition in a three week period requires going back to square one and getting yet another referral from the primary care doctor and then waiting ANOTHER SIX WEEKS before you get in to see the doctor again. There are too many health care options to settle for such ignorance and poor service. You're FIRED!
2,"I have seen this show 3 times now since 2008. It's a great way to get dinner and a cheap show. I have heard from people who have been to medieval times that it's very similar but since I haven't been there, I can't judge. \n\nLast nights experience wasn't as good as the first couple times but it was still good. My fianc\u00e9s chicken was very moist but mine was pretty dried out. All else was good except that my waiter didn't refill my drink until the show was almost over (it had been empty for 15 minutes and he walked by it 4 times but never stopped) he did fill my fianc\u00e9's cup but she was drinking something different and I guess he couldn't be bothered to bring the sprite to me. \n\nThe show was good as always but I missed the acrobat that used to perform at the end that has been replaced by the show horse. Oh well. I still enjoyed it and would probably do it again for a decent show and meal at a good price.  I recommend it."
3,"Very good pub food. Had the Pub Spots, Deviled Eggs and Crisps I recommend this place."
4,"I vacillated between four and five stars for this place due to the fact that when I hold it up to all of the restaurant experiences and food I have had, it fits more into a four star but when I compare it to other Vegas dining experiences, it is a clear five so five it is!\n\nBasically, it is just a really nice place with a great menu, superb service, and delicious food.  We started with oysters on the half shell which were excellently shucked and wonderfully fresh. Moved to two salads, one with blue cheese and walnuts, the other with warm goat cheese over dressed greens which were both executed well and were complimented with fresh chewy delicious bread. \n\nFor entrees, my husband had the lamb and I had the chicken. We also opted for sides of mushrooms and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent however the mushrooms were over salted. Considering this wasn't a theme in the meal, I won't hold it against them. \n\nAll of this was accompanied with a nice and inexpensive bottle of white wine which was served and presented as if it was a $300 bottle. That kind of service is always an indicator of a well run restaurant and an attentive staff. Overall cost of the meal was expensive but very, very fairly priced for when we got. \n\nAfter visiting a wide array of places in Vegas, I would recommend this place as a must!"
0,"Avoid this place! Happy hour is a joke, our bill came to a 100.00 for 6 drinks and 2 meals! We asked for a double on vodka and soda and it came in the same small glass as a single and tasted exactly like the single serving. After a 5 of them, we asked the waitress what is the cost for vodka and soda doubles. She said well happy hour is 5.25 and 7.25 for double. Them came back and said, I was wrong they are a $11.50!! What?!? Double charge for an extra half a shot!?! We were ordering something simple and it was supposed to be happy hour and by No means did we think they would double the charge for the same size drink with no more of a punch that the singles! No bars in Phoenix charge this but this place! The manager was confronted because 1. Her wait staff should inform people of the outrageous pricing when they order and ours was shocked of the price! 2. She needs to do some research with other bars and realize this is a rip off! The manager justified their charges, but credited a couple of shots we did. Very small gesture but a gesture! Food is ok, waitress neglected us most of night, atmosphere only thing nice about this place. Our table spent well over $300.00 for just 4 hours of being there, so what does that tell you? Ridiculous! We left without even a slight buzz (which is strange because they were supposedly 2 shots per drink) and we did 2 shot of tequila...fishy if you ask me! We will NEVER be back and I hope this helps you to ask about their prices before you order because the staff will not tell you! We will stay with the reasonable and respectable places we have been going to for years!!! This place is a huge disappointment!"
2,It was nicely air conditioned.  The only downfall is lack of seating.  Most of the venues are standing only.  Not too great when you are standing for hours.  I probably would have stayed through the whole concert if I wasn't already standing during the opening act.
1,"Save your money and your time... your taste buds will thank you.\n\nI'll start with the service.  Pretty lousy actually, even for a Korean place.  I had to actually get up and request soybean paste b/c I couldn't wait any longer.  Crappy service.\n\nThe side dishes lacked flavor and pizazz.  Totally unimpressed.  The BBQ meat lacked flavor and more importantly, tasted BOILED.  I'm not kidding my first impression was Yoshinoya beef bowl (Cali folks will understand this), seriously.  I saw no physical indication of bbq'ing, nor did it taste like it.... the bottom of the iron dish was filled with liquid like they had just removed it from boiling water.  We also got this specialty rice bowl with beef and veggies was only good when smothered in hot sauce.\n\nTotally unimpressed and will not come back."
4,"I love, love, love Thai Basil! It is fast, reasonably priced and, best of all, DELICIOUS! One thing that is really great is they have a lunch special for $6.95 that includes a cup of a vegetable broth soup, entr\u00e9e and egg roll (the menu said \""fruit\"" also, but it's really just a slice of orange to drizzle on your entr\u00e9e, which is a nice touch). I think their Thai iced tea is fabulous also. It's a classy place and yet feels very comfortable, and you know it must be good because a lot of people of Asian descent eat here on a regular basis. My favorite dishes are the noodle ones, like pad thai and pad-see-ew, hubby likes the rice dishes, but we both go for the tofu. It's nice to be able to eat totally vegetarian and have a delicious filling meal. If you're like us, you'll go back again and again!"
4,"excellent work from start to finish!  (which was only one day for the entire remove-and-replace of my 1200sf ranch)  ...we had previously been burned by a disreputable roofing company, but tyler was consistently patient and understanding through my many questions, and helped me work through hiccups with insurance payment(s) long after the work had been completed.\nthe crew was efficient and deliberate in their methods, and they left the jobsite almost exactly as they had arrived (except, of course, for the beautiful new roof).  tyler was always available to answer questions about the project before they got underway, as well as after completion.\nfinding a roofer can be a daunting task, but i would strongly recommend you allow johnson roofing to take a look at your project and find out, first hand, just how easy roof replacement can be..."
3,"I really enjoy Donato's. The food is terrific-love the pasta sauce and chocolate rubbed steak!! Great wine list!!!\n\nI've taken company, out of towners, etc. there. Really impressive!"
2,"I decided to stop in before going to see Sarah Brightman at Jobing Dot Com Arena. I was off to a late start but wanted to enjoy a good meal before the show to make a night of it. \n\nI enjoyed the ambiance of the place right off. The usual dark wood and dark booths but I liked the decor. It just looked 'comfortable' to me for lack of a better word. \n\nThe place was busy....most of it seemed pre-concert rush. I was told my server would be right there and then in a minute or so the manager came over to get a drink order. My server was at an adjacent table and seemed to be dealing with a 'problem' table. From what I could hear it seemed to be one of those \""I want this....BUT with this and not with that...and with this on the side....\"" type of tables. So he was busy. \n\nThey had a special menu that was featuring a pork tenderloin with a maple glaze that sounded really good. I did ask the server if it was a quick dish to come out and was told they were all ready out of it for the evening. Which was fine....hey, you snooze, you lose. So I ordered the goat cheese ravioli. \n\nIt came out pretty quick and I was actually quite impressed with the dish. It was served with some sauteed spinach and had a handful of pine nuts tossed in. Pasta, goat cheese, spinach, pine nuts....right up my alley. Don't think they could go wrong with that for me if they tried. \n\nOn the special menu they were offering a pumpkin cheesecake which sounded awfully good to me. I checked the time and I was doing pretty good so I was debating if I should get a slice. \n\nWell, all of a sudden my server dropped off my check. \""Whenever you're ready\"". Okay....no dessert I guess. He picked up my empty plate and was gone. \n\nI wasn't quite sure if he knew I was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there. I did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so I'm not sure if he just assumed I was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what. As a whole I really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while I'm still eating...but I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one. \n\nOn the way out I did ask when they closed because I was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that wouldn't work. \n\nSo, next time I'm in the area I'd like to check it out again when I have some more time. Some of the menu items sounded pretty good and like I said earlier I did enjoy the atmosphere so I would like to relax and enjoy a meal there at a not so hectic time. \n\nA solid three stars.....and hopefully will bump it up with a review update when I get to visit a second time."
3,"Archis is was one of the better Thai food restaurants in Vegas. I've been going here for years. I usually get the Penang, Thai beef salad, pad kea mow. Can't go wrong with any of those."
2,"Just as the title implies the burgers are flame broiled to perfection. I have never had a bad burger here. \n   It's a little on the expensive side, but if your craving a specialty burger it's totally worth it. \n   The downside is that unfortunately most other things on the menu aren't really worth the money. The hotdogs are small and the gyros aren't exactly the best either. luckily the fries are not to salty and have a home made taste.\n   There a good areas to eat outside and there is a drive through window. Also they can deliver in most cases which is always a nice treat."
4,"Legit.\n\nThe Barrymore has been a seminal contribution to the post-2009 Las Vegas lounge renaissance.  \n\nThe restaurant is small, the service is old Vegas both in style and literally, with some wait staff known to discriminating customers for decades here.  They seem to know when to show up and when to leave you to your conversation.  The booths are classic design and the ambiance almost unmatched.  The menu is sophisticated French fusion.  Beautiful presentations which the chef makes sure are as you like them.\n\nThe bar has an outdoor patio heated in the winter.  Inside is a small lounge area at which they often have some of the best entertainers in Las Vegas, including Nieve Malandra singing jazz and standards. \n\nThe room off the east end of the bar could use some re-thinking, perhaps best for private events only.  Be sure to be seated in the main restaurant for dining.  Full menu at the bar and the perfect cocktail join a large wine list.  \n\nThe design is a very sophisticated theme based on the Barrymore motion picture family.  Well done and one of my favorite haunts."
3,"This is my \""go-to\"" spot. I normally order pho Bo vien large extra meatball and a large tsingtao. I like the larger sizes of meatballs they use and the broth is pretty delicious. This place is usually good on getting your pho to you in a timely manner, but the the same could be said with most pho places since it's not that difficult to prepare. I have yet to venture from my usual but when I do, I shall review it."
2,Can't beat the 99 cent Bloody Mary's in the morning. We had a super bar tender that made ours extra spicy. The mexican breakfast was delicious.
1,"Like Yelps awesome description for each star ranking,this place is really just ''meh''.\n\nGreat place to JUST have drinks on the terrace during the warm summer days/nights.\n\nFood: I mean, it's Italian food. There's really nothing 'that' great about it, and without tooting my own horn, I feel there's a lot of things on the menu that my friends and I could make. But yes, it is good.\n\nStaff : Nothing special, but nothing bad neither. \n\nDecor/ambiance : probably one of the good things of this place. It has a nice urban/old style to it. \nLOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. This place is perfectly located on one of the most touristy streets in the city. \n\nI'd take friends there only if we haven't made plans/reservations. It's acceptable."
0,"After being gone for nearly two months, the far to overzealous sign spinner employed by this business IS UNFORTUNATELY BACK at 202 and Chandler and the manager of this place hung up on me when I was discussing the problem again.  I guess I'll have to resort to uploading to youtube the dash-cam videos of this idiot sign spinner repeatedly dropping his sign in the street and the antics and lengths he goes to to get attention for this business which is obviously not successful enough with its existing customer base to stay in business.  Businesses that are successful and packed do so by remembering who the customer is and providing a good product at a fair price, NOT by trying to attract so much attention that they risk causing traffic accidents and repeatedly annoy drivers to the point they call the police!  The traffic accident most likely to occur is one where a driver is trying to turn the corner and is distracted by this idiot's sign or yelling and they get hit T-bone style RIGHT IN THE DRIVERS DOOR!  I knew someone that was T-boned in the drivers side and SHE AND HER 10 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER ARE DEAD!!!!!  If you want to take back our streets from the idiot sign spinners like the one used by this business, DON'T GO THERE!!!  I would never again think of going to this business!"
0,Over priced and no customer service.
1,It's ok. Pretending to be the real St-viateur. but the bagels aren't as good. I'd give it a 2.5 if they would let me.
4,We frequent here often but I'd never taken the time to post a review. I cannot say a negative thing about Cyprus. The staff are amazing. They are prompt to serve us and the food is always fast and fresh. They have opened a new location in Chandler and we have been there quite a few times as well. I can honestly say they do everything right and it is consistent at both locations. \n\nGreek fries are a must and my husband loves the gyro pita and I love the chicken souvlaki pita.
2,"An A.D.D. sports fan's dream! We were in Scottsdale for the weekend and wanted to watch the UFC event and have drinks and food.......we ended up here!\n\nThe waitresses appear to be Hooters' girls prior to enhancement. Cute outfits and pretty gals.\n\nThe service was a tad slow but the waitress was working her butt off, as it was busy due to it being an Oklahoma game and this being the local alums hangout. There were screens all around, friendly people, good atmosphere. The food was what prevented a higher rating. It was \""okay\"" and that is typical for a bar. All in all, a fun place to go, though!"
0,"Let's face it, these places are not free. If you feel like you deserve to live in a place that is properly cleaned and maintained you will have to place a lot of work orders. Most apartments have managers who make sure the place is clean and well maintained. This is not one of those places. Filth and chipped paint is everywhere. There is no excuse. A 20 second slop a mop does not cut it."
4,"This bar is in the Blair house suites hotel which was just remodeled, and they added this place just about 6-9 months ago. I must say that I did not expect much from this place, but the bartenders, food, and the video poker where all awesome, and all the flat screens weren't bad. Drinks were strong, food absolutely amazing!"
1,"Came by here again on a slow weeknight hoping for a better experience. While the food was better this time around, they were once again missing several menu items and the service was still extremely rude, slow, and inattentive. Sad to learn that these problems are systemic and were not just the result of the Restaurant Week crowds. I won't be giving them a third chance."
4,"King of night clubs Is the best to book events. The owner Joe always made\nSure my group and I had a great time. He's very informative, oranized and helpful with everything. His parties are always a blast!!! Joanne"
0,We went to rescue a baby kitten and was turned down because I didn't want them contacting a landlord due to fees . I think it's sad they turned it down and when my bf said he would keep it at his house they still said no because they didn't want the kitten at my house . SO we had to find a kitten another way. Sad they say to rescue fur babies but we couldn't our kids were sad leaving this place instead of happy .
2,"Okay so yes Mike and Tony's has arguably the best Gyro in the Burgh, but the love affair for me ends there.  Oh and just a gyro is less than $5.00 dollars which makes for a very affordable lunch.  The downtown location is gross, there was bum piss in the door way. It should be some ones job to wash away the bum piss before they open their doors for business. The mural on the wall is very outdated and looks cheesy and the plaster is chipping away inside.  If anything just take your gyro to go.\n\nI have never eaten anything besides a gyro from Mike and Tonys but my boyfriend likes the grilled chicken salads."
1,"We haven't been here in a long while.  Not impressed, most of the food is cold. Crab legs have no taste or just taste gross. \nTerriyaki chicken was dry as was the sweet &sour chicken, pork ribs too fatty. \nNot coming back."
0,"I agree with Kristen.    I was there with my girlfriend, who is a bridesmaid in my sisters wedding, and the owner was very condesending about an issue my girlfriend had.   While it wasn't a big issue, we were talked down to and made to feel like idiots.    I recommend going any other shop where they will be happy to help you, and make you feel special for your special occassion, and you will not have any issues, glitches, or wrong dress sizes."
2,"I will reiterate what many others have said. Food is above average. Service is poor. We've been there half a dozen times and besides waiting a long time for our food, they almost always forget something or bring us the wrong food. With better servers/server training, this place could be 4 stars easy."
2,"Conspicuously, I crossed the threshold.  The varnish of the oaken door was peeling, worn away, the brassen latch-pull tarnished.  \""A table for three,\"" I said.  \""The remainder of my party will be here directly.\""  The maitre'd condescended to fix upon me a stern look.  \""I'm sorry, sir.\""  She said, her bangs bobbed in front of me.  \""We cannot seat you until everyone who will be joining you is here.  Feel free to have a seat at the bar until they arrive.\""\n\nI glanced barward.  Smart suits and ties, polished oxfords.  Where was I?  I thought to myself.  What in God's name are these people on about? \n\nI sidled up akin a middle aged woman, her dried out blonde hair had given way to brunette roots, a sprinkle of grey visible from my proximity.  She sipped a cocktail of some kind, probably some kinda vodka.  I signaled to the barkeep, asked for a whiskey;  I had a gut ache from the night before and only the hair of the dog could combat it.  \""Seven fifty\"", the barman said sliding a curled slip of white paper my direction.  I fingered around my changepurse, pulling out a handful of all I could find.  \""This is robbery,\"" I said as I tossed the money his way.\n\nThe entryway bell jingled and I looked back hoping to see my companions.  No such luck.  An elderly couple dressed like they just come from a church service stood there, the woman's yellow scarf waving in the soft breeze.  I guessed my comrades weren't gonna make it.  Maybe they'd been caught?  Or worse.  I put the thought out of my head and my mind rested easy on the sack of loot on my back and the warm sixgun by my side. You know, a guy like me could add quite a few more greenbacks to today's haul in a place like this.  My hand fell to my side."
3,"I joined Capital Fitness for two reasons: \n1. it is right downtown and easy to walk to, \n2. They have personal TVs attached to many of the cardio machines, making working out fly by. \n\nOther than that, the locker rooms are always clean and empty, the staff is very friendly and helpful, there is free parking underneath the building, and it never seems packed or empty. \n\nAdditionally, you can pay month-to-month, which was unique to Cap Fitness when I researched a few places in January 2009."
4,"Wait, you passed it.  Turn around. OK, now where to park? Valet or the garage underneath the restaurant? Now that I've found a space where are the signs to get upstairs to the restaurant. \n\nOnce you get through finding the place, parking, going upstairs all the work will be worth it. \n\nThe sweet potato fries aren't fried, they taste better than the alternative and they're the reason I'm going to keep coming back. I started with the sweet potato avocado salad that had the perfect texture. The agave nectar soda is guilt free and so good. \n\nThe best thing is, even though I'm vegan, my friends who eat there love the burgers and the fact that everyone can get the best of both worlds. It's not just True Food Kitchen anymore."
4,"I've got to give this place a 5 star! We drove from Maricopa to go furniture shopping and decided to stop here for lunch. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely, and the staff was very friendly. My boyfriend had the carne asada burrito and I had the shredded chicken chimichanga. While we waited we helped ourselves to their chips and salsas. Now, I am very picky with chips and salsa, I really like fresh authentic Mexican food and can't stand things like pace picante and tostitos, sorry but no. The New Mexican Grill has awesome chips and salsa!!! Even though I usually like thinner chips, I really enjoyed theirs. Our food came out piping hot and everything was flavorful and moist, nothing was dried out, including the rice. Both the green and red hatch chilies were very tasty; i preferred the red and my boyfriend liked the green better. Also their prices were pretty fair so that's always a plus. We had an excellent experience and will absolutely be going back!"
3,"Good food, good service and I didn't have to wait long for food. Will be back next time I am in the neighborhood."
0,"Horrible Valentines Day experience!! I booked a \""Celebrity Spa Suite\"" over 2 weeks before the day. We got there right at check in time (3:00pm) and waited 45 min JUST to get up to the counter! These lines weren't long by the way. I get up there to find out they don't have my room or \""any king beds in the whole hotel!\"" They offered me a \""Bungalow Queen\"" which is certainly a downgrade! It's Valentines Day I want a king! I was told its not a downgrade because it's still a suite. Pssh... That just means a couch in a sitting area apparently, and wonky lights.  Manager ended up giving us a food and beverage credit which we made sure to use ALL of! \n\nDon't make a reservation here... They might not have it when you get there!"
1,"EH, for all the waiting, and all the heat, and all the hype, and all the expense....this really wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Honestly? The Frozen Hot Chocolate just sounds cool. Go to Starbucks (or somewhere else that's cheaper) and get a Frappaccino for half the price and half the wait. In my opinion, this place is WAAAAYYYY overrated."
2,"Went to Ri Ra on the 3rd day they were open, during the soft opening.  There wasn't  a live band, so I can't say how it is when one is playing.  I like the layout of the place - the whole left side is one long bar and the whole right side is seating and booths.  Even though there was no band, it was pretty noisy and pub-like.\n\nThe food was just ok.  The boyfriend got the shepherd's pie and it was ok.  I tried the Kilbeggan Salmon and it was pretty delicious.  Appetizers were crab cakes and onion rings.  The crab cakes themselves were just alright, but the sauce that they put on them was awesome!  I really liked the onion rings - the were the tiny, thin cut onions and were super tasty.\n\nService was slow, but they were pretty busy and had only been open a couple of days, so I'll forgive it.  Our waiter (can't remember his name, but he was Irish) was super nice and chatty.  I'll definitely try this place again."
4,"Beautiful poker room with plenty of money and action. It's got an open airy feel to it, very comfortable place to play. One of the top 3 places I go to play poker when I'm in town."
2,Expensive for what you're getting.  Food is good.
4,"This was a great find, thanks to my friend & yelp! It is a bit pricey but worth it if you're looking for amazing quality and flavor and great service! I had the pork tenderloin, which I never get since it always comes out dry but this was cooked perfectly, med rare and so so much flavor. \n\nTry Mesa Grill, you won't regret it!"
1,"I always enjoy trying new styles of bbq, this is Chicago style bbq! Being from Texas you get used just one style TEXAS! The location is in a strip mall a decent but not very desirable area. When I first walked in the place had interesting decor from the bathroom doors being a Pepsi machine! The wait was a little long to order at the counter but I'm a patient man. I ordered up the brisket sand which basket came w one side and a pickle for about $10. Little over priced but it did come w a drink. The brisket was served w a little fat which I like and the sauce was good. The  potato salad tasted pre made from a tub. I'd recommend trying the place once but not sure I'll be back as there are certainly better bbq in phx."
1,"Mediocre buffet with a good selection of desserts (except for the cheap tasting gelato).\n\nDespite the Wynn-fanciness, the ambiance still felt like a chinsy buffet.  \n\nMy work has better food.  I wouldn't do this place again."
0,"I had lunch at this restaurant and ordered their specialty duck dish. The price was hefty so I expected to be at least decent. What I got was a piece of duck that was fried to a crisp. The meat tastes like jerky and hard as a rock. When I complained to the staff, the manager said that this is the way the duck is usually cooked at their restaurant and would not even bother to replace it for me. I had only eaten a bite! Even their staff member did not agree with the managers decision to do nothing. For 23.00 dish it was a waste! Don't bother with this establishment. It does not even deserve a 1 star!"
1,"Would have loved to try this place. They were constantly closed on Sunday mornings, like at 9am...what bakery does that?!\n\""LUNCH SPECIAL\"" in their window...and they were closed.\nSo the wife and I gave up.\nNow its turning into a pizza shop (again), we'll see if they survive, this is the 3rd business it has been in 2 years"
2,This the second time I've eaten here. Both times the food was good. The blues band that was there was really good. I also liked the 1/2 price drinks.\n\nThe first time the service was good. The second time we came for lunch and they only had a bartender doing drinks and waiting tables. She was not overly friendly and seemed to take a long time since there were only two tables.\n\nI would recommend giving this place a try. Maybe for dinner not lunch.
3,"If you have a Platinum Amex you get to go in for \""free\"" (or the annual cost of the platinum card which more than covers the cost of your 1 buffet meal in the Centurion lounge). The chairs are comfortable and the food is fine. The lounge gets crowded so once you find a seat, you should probably stay. Haven't been to other Centurion lounges but hopefully they are all like this one."
2,"Pretty fun themed casino like out of Camelot, but with all the modern amenities. This I would say is one of the easier hotels to get lost in though as far as Vegas goes. Unlike many other hotels in Vegas though, I'm not a fan of many of their dining options. The Beware of the \""body snatchers\"" prevalent at this property who REALLY press you for the time share sell. While dated, it's still a fun place to kill a few hours."
4,"Dropped by for lunch with a friend.  I love the vibe an decor here....it's very modern and chic.  I ordered a Triple Grilled Cheese Sandwich (Provolone, American, and Cheddar Cheese on Griddled Texas Toast, $7.95 & Tomatoes, $.95).  It comes with a complimentary side of Caesar Salad....bonus!\n\nThe Grilled Cheese Sandwich was awesome!  The thick Texas Toast was griddled perfectly....not too burnt, but not too soft....and the combination of Cheeses was just right.....the Tomato provided a nice, juicy & sweet flavor to the Sammie!  Next time, I'll also add Avocado to the Sammie for $.95 more.\n\nOur server was great too.....patient with us as we talked and browsed the menu.\n\nOverall, it was an awesome dining experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 100%"
0,"Went here with the family for NYE dinner.  Food was half good and half horrible.  Kitchen closed and sent home all of the chefs (except the pastry chef) before we even had the plates delivered.  They should never have taken the reservation for a party of 14 at the end of the night.  They were running 40 mins behind and still seated us, but only to poorly execute the food and service. They didn't even have bread for the table or any of the entrees...this is an italian restaurant!  They finally brought us some frozen bread to try to appease us. It was still frozen in the middle.   If you are going to take a reservation at the end of the night, then you should make sure you have the right people there to execute at the level you should be for the type of restaurant you are. I live in NYC and have no problem paying higher prices for good food, but having to pay high prices for crappy food is just ridiculous.  Very disappointed and will never go back!"
0,I moved here about a month ago and it has been the worst apartments I lived in two bad I sign a year lease. With in the first weak or so we started to see roaches n they fumigated then next weak we seen them again plus we started to get bit by bed bugs wich are not in our Matress but in the bathroom which of course were stuck with paying 150$ for the fumigation of them. They tell you the apartment is cable ready is not one aux cable wrks the cable guy said all the other ones look nice with there covers but some there in between the walls the cable is chopped so is not cable ready. My rent is 735$ but after allocated water service 44.88 allocated sewer service 25.07local sales tax14.80allocated trash service3.70monthly service charge5.03and new account fee10$ it adds up to my new rent been 838.48 big difference this apartments are not recommended take it from me I live here till my lease is up 11 more months
3,"Our last several hours spent in Vegas were dedicated to visiting Margaritaville for both a good meal and drinks. We were also expecting to be able to get our hands on the tall, long margarita cups that we assumed were sold here, but we were disappointed to find out that we were at the wrong place for this. Nonetheless, it did not prevent us from having our final meal in Vegas.\n\nUpon arrival, we noticed a handful of people waiting to be seated and hoped that it wouldn't be a long wait as our flight departed in a couple hours. Luckily, from the time we requested a table to actually being seated, it was no more than 15 minutes. Our server assisted us within 5 minutes of being seated and took our drink orders. There were a variety of drinks to choose from; I ordered the Big Rita on the rocks and also was interested in the Mango Frozen margarita. Both were excellent and brought to us 5 minutes after ordering them. We didn't order appetizers but it was really amazing seeing what the Volcano nachos looked like at the table next to ours. One word describes them: humongous! As for our food, we ordered burgers, quesadillas, and a chicken burger, all of which came with fries. The food was much better than expected and delicious. The burger was full of flavor and went perfectly with my drink. \n\nThe staff was friendly, the portions were generous and the overall quality excellent.  The prices are reasonable with the drinks always being expensive as with the rest of Vegas."
3,I really like rubios. It tastes great and seems fresh.
0,"Just terrible, I ordered fajitas expecting chicken cooked over a grill, nope I got pan fried, flavorless garbage. The waitress was a ditz that couldn't be bothered and she forgot to comp the free chips and salsa. Oh and it was ridiculously loud we had to sit next to these old ladies playing majong and it sounded like a combine was driving over my head every time they scrambled the pieces. I officially hate this chilis the only good thing about the meal was the chicken enchilada soup which must come out of a bag otherwise I can't see how it doesn't suck like everything else. Bad food, bad service, way to loud, why is there no negative star rating? This place gets negative two stars. If the sign on the door didn't say chilis I would have thought I was sitting in a dumpster behind the circle k that serves food next to a jet engine testing facility. Thanks Chilis for making burger king look like fine dining."
1,"This popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings.\nLocated in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.\nThe restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.\nWe ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.\nIn seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.\nViva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa."
0,"I went to this establishment on November 20th, 2012.  I walk in and nobody is standing at the cash register to greet me and ask me for my order.  I had to ask the lady to get somebody to take my order. After I gave my order I waited for 5 minutes and nobody started making my wrap.  Then when I got my wrap it was freezing cold (spicy chick wrap).  It was absolutely disgusting.  And it was close to $8.  Do not go here.  Bad service/Bad food.  Also, the boy making my wrap would not stop staring and laughing at me.  How awkward and unprofessional."
1,"Not a bad place, service was good. Price seemed a bit high for what it was, I had the gyro pita which only had 4 slices of gyro meat on it. Pita bread was delicious. \n\nParking can be a bit chaotic, but they have an attendant to help guide you and manage the flow. Inside feels a bit cramped for me, but it also seems like they do a decent carry out business."
4,"Happiness is a warm bagel.\n\nOwen's claim to fame is their bagel steaming process.  Before I came here, I had no idea what bagel steaming entailed, but it beats the heck out of toasting.  Bagels (and bagel sandwiches) go in the steamer as regular bagels.  A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. \n\nI ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.\n\nThe wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.\n\nPerhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.  But if you can talk your server into popping a cookie into the steamer, it comes out chewey and melty like it was fresh from the oven.\n\nOwen's bagel shop might be a little tough to find, but the bagels make it worth seeking out."
1,"Dawn P is on the right track\n\nService is great!\n\nAs for the food...\n\nWe tried the carnivore pizza - just a notch above frozen pizza\n\nIced tea tastes like water, and the bar tender agreed, but could not fix the mix. She graciously offered an alternative.\n\n\nWe will give em another try in a month or to."
1,"My wife and I were really looking forward to dinner at RC. . . .but overall we were disappointed.\n\nLet me start out with some positives . . . the setting, our table by the window and our server were excellent.  Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.\n\nI ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\n\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\n\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\n\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\n\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\n\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\n\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.  Johnny the bartender was great too . . .but he left after he tried a month or two at RC . . . now I know why he left."
0,You pay a fee to get in. You pick your own parts then they charge you gold prices for used steel. I wanted 2 brackets & the price started at a rediculous $75. I bawked & the price dropped 2 more times. I still ended up paying way too much for sum lousy brackets. I inquired about some other parts I wanted and for a couple bucks more I should just buy brand new with a warranty. Crazy huh!!!
3,"I'm giving them a star bump because the last time I went the service was a lot more attentive for the afternoon tea. They even didn't charge us the upcharge for sharing pots of tea! This may have been an oversight but I didn't mind not paying extra to try the different teas.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the most busy place, and I'm curious to see if they stay in business for long since both times I went I was close to the only party in the restaurant. We'll see, and I wish them the best!"
0,"Worse show I have ever seen. The fact she was lip syncing was absolutely disappointing. There was a huge crowd and good vibe but the show overall was bad. My wife and I left and gave our tickets to a couple in the last row. Britney danced as if she was hurt....wait, did I write dance? more like she walked around while her dancers did all the dancing. So, no singing, no dancing, bad outfits well...it sucked.\nSorry Britney. I thought I was a fan till I saw you live. One more, thing please ask Planet Hollywood to upgrade your sound system. Not the worse thing you have done in Las Vegas but a close second."
2,"I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.\n\nThe restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.\n\nI was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \""Chicago\"" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.\n\nLike other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.\n\nOur server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance."
1,"Thought we would give this place a try in our new neighborhood. Started with spring rolls that were uneatable-the meat tasted rancid and was an off color. Our entrees (beef filet pieces & rice) was just okay. The rice was my favorite part of the whole meal, but it's kind of hard to mess up steamed rice. My partner had the mixed grill (beef, chicken, shrimp) stir fry noodles. It was okay other than very fishy-tasting shrimp. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress standing behind the counter wiping & picking her nose with her hand and not washing them after!!"
4,"This is a hidden gem for sure!  Everything from the service, atmosphere, food innovation and taste, home run!  The owner personally introduced himself to us, the service (front and back of the house) was educated, informative, attentive, and passionate.  Very cool, romantic or lounge type vibe to the area.  Food was very creative.  Pizzas are outstanding.  The attention to details in flavor profile was on point too.  I had the chicken marsala and that extra flare of Grand Marnier in there adding the citrus notes was on point!  I'm scared to tell the world about this place b/c I want to be able to get a table any time I want!  :)"
0,"I would not return to this restaurant. First off you start your dining experience with 6 menus, and they aren't even nice, well thought out menus, they are printed on computer paper, stapled and dirty. They do not have descriptions of their rolls or drinks and it is unnecessary and confusing to have that many menus. Their prices seem reasonable until you realize how small the portions are. The taste wasn't bad but after a $50 tab, my guest and I left unsatisfied and still hungry. They have a $5 tapas menu which I tried the bacon wrapped dates off of. There were only 5 dates which tasted amazing but again, the portion was ridiculous. The same thing with the rolls, the caterpillar had great flavor but there were 8 slices of the smallest roll I've ever had and it cost $13. To top it off, service was extremely slow even though the restaurant wasn't very busy and my guest and I had to help a fellow customer in a wheelchair maneuver around their tiny restaurant. There are too many fantastic sushi places in the area to waste your time on this one."
0,"Sorry PAM (owner) but your place was terrible!!! My daughter had a so called cheese omelet (tiny tiny tiny tiny), it looked like something I was served on an airplane. The omelet consisted of one egg, maybe just maybe two very small eggs, paper thin deli ham (2 slices) little bit of finely shredded cheese, no toast, and a small side of dried out potatoes BTW the omelet was served on a plastic plate. To add insult they charged $7.95 for this. I had a egg and bacon breakfast burrito again very small, it was OK. Having read some of the other reviews me thinks that they are a sham by friends and relatives. This place is the worst!!!!"
0,"I can't stand to be lied straight face from a bunch of grown up men!!! They think we are idiots... They all look so retarded!!! ! We as family used to like them, and one of the guys tried to treat us pretty good, but, now I would not recommend anyone to be taking advantage of like they have been doing to us. We were told that this exactly shop was on the news for a bad reputation and at first I couldn't believe it, but after leaving there today and open my car and see that the floor matt was dirty and all curl up after asking several times to make sure to put a protect paper or plastic so it will not dirt the carpet ... I'm pssssd and I can't stand them anymore.... I guess they don't need business anymore.... The dirty carpet it's not the worse part, the worse part is that they're a bunch of crooks and they look like pot heads and act like them too!!!! That's my story and I'm sticking to it!!!"
2,"A lot has changed at this place.   All new faces and a whole different food.  But honestly the taste of the food has fallen below my expectation.   \n\nThey had the best Hakka Noodles, Indian style chilli chicken, Gobi Manchurian and Goan shrimp.   But not anymore.   Even their special biriyani looks and tastes different.   \n\nI would give them one more chance before taking them off my favorite restaurants list."
4,"The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \n\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \""curry-like\"" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \n\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back."
4,This store was great with great customer service! The employee recommended good phones and features and was very knowledgeable. I recommend this store to anyone!
4,i came here with my fiancee a little while back.. it's one of the more memorable places in all of scotland.. give yourself about 3-4 hours to full take in the entire experience.. and don't forget to get their early to avoid the lines..
0,"I created a Yelp account specifically to warn people of this place - that's how bad it was. Of the thousands of restaurants I've been to I have never felt the need to write a review so this is a first. First of all, the food was terrible. Just on that fact alone I would never go back. In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella. Thank god I had left over pizza to come home to from earlier in the day. Even though I live right next to it, this will definitely be my one and only experience with Toros Spanish Kitchen and Tapas."
4,"I went here for the first time on Friday night. Now, I do not drink beer, I hate beer BUT all of my friends drink it so I goto breweries for support. I was impressed with NMBC, the interior was awesome, I loved seeing the stills and the whole rear wall is doors that open to a patio that were open. Our waiter was kick ass and was the epitome of customer service. There was some great live music going on and it wasn't some horrible hipsters.\nNow, as I said, I do not drink beer so I had a coke. It took me awhile to read the menu to decide what to eat, everyone raved about the crab dip and said the chicken sandwich and burgers were not worth eating. I decoded to get the all-meat 7\"" pizza and damnit, that was a FANTASTIC choice. Though I do not drink beer, I will come back for the atmosphere and the pizza. I gave 5 stars for the pizza."
1,"I'm really sad I have to come back and udate my review.  We visited Island again last Friday and had a pretty bad experience.  The service was AWFUL.  We went as a group of 6.... all ordered AYCE.  We had to wait almost 40 minutes between our first order and our second.  That's really unacceptable.\n\nAs far as we could see, there were only 2 guys actually making the sushi.  On a Friday night at 6:30?  That's crazy.  And that would probably explain what the hold up was.\n\nOur waitress wouldn't even come near us or make eye contact with us during that 40 minutes, while we were trying to get her attention to find out what was going on.  When we finally flagged down a DIFFERENT server to ask what the problem was, he acted like he couldn't care less.  \""Yeah, we know we're having problems.  You have 90 minutes, don't worry.\""  Lame.\n\nThere were still some very yummy rolls, but worth waiting an hour and a half for?  Not at all.  \n\nIt was very disappointing."
1,"Nice hotel, but beware if you suffer from hot flashes or you prefer a cold room!  The thermostats in their rooms are locked so they will not go below 68 degrees.  I have never come across this situation in all my years of traveling. Seriously, the hallway was cooler than my room! Don't get me wrong ... 68 is a fine and dandy temperature, but I happen to be dealing with pre-menopausal symptoms, including those delightful hot flashes. 68 was not going to cut it. \n\nI called the front desk and the phone rang about 37 times before I gave up and tried the operator.  I asked the operator for the \""secret phone line at the front desk that they actually pick up,\"" which she gave me and the indifferent clerk finally answered.  I asked for a fan in my room, but they do not provide those for guests.  What a big fat jip!  \n\nWe had to change our plans for the evening since we had to check out and scurry around Boulder Hwy looking for another room for the night, which ate up an hour of our party time.  GRRRRR!  Ended up at the Super 8 motel on Boulder Hwy, which is a bit of a dive, but at least their a/c puts out!"
0,"It's really too bad that Yelp doesn't have a negative star rating because that's what I would give the this hotel.\n\nThere are three adjectives that I use to describe this facility are rude, inefficient, and arrogant (plus tacky and unclean!)\n\nOn July 3rd, our Auto Club travel agent made a reservation for us for August 17 through the 19th.  We put the lodging fees on our credit card--had a receipt showing both the payment and the reservation.\n\nOn August 17th, after driving over 600 miles through rain and lightning storms from Northern California, I went to the front desk to check in for our family.  The clerk looked at his computer and said our reservation had been cancelled on July 17th (and our credit had still be charged).  I was shocked and showed him my receipt and reservation document.  He went to talk to his manager (Matthew) who basically told me that he would do what he could but if his superior said no we would be out of luck (that meant that my wife, daughter, and myself, after paying and making reservations, would have no place to stay.) \n\nI became furious because we had paid, the hotel staff had listed the wrong date on the reservation, and rather showing compassion and concern, Matthew showed as much warmth as an iceberg in the Arctic.  When I reacted in anger, he said he wasn't going to do anything that would guarantee us a stay. We then were forced to go find another hotel to stay at for the evening (this at 11:15 pm on a Friday night).\n\nI wrote a letter to their CEO almost a month ago detailing what had happened and heard nothing back from him.\n\nWhen it comes to reliability, courtesy, and concern, THIS HOTEL IS NOT A HARD ROCK IT IS A SOFT PEBBLE."
4,"Yummy!!! Oishi!!! \n\nLove this place. Its not pretentious and the food is good. I wish the restaurant was bigger so I don't have to wait in line so long! (As well, a bit bigger so I don't feel like a freaking elephant when I try to squeeze by to get a seat).\n\nI like their shrimp burger and their salmon tartar bowl (and their salmon salad for that matter) was extremely tasty.\n\nDon't go there with children. Not enough room!"
4,"I love a good cocktail.  I mean, who doesn't?  This place provides just that.  The menu offers some excellent choices and, if you're open-minded, you can put yourself at \""The Mercy of the Bartender.\""  It a cocktail made of whatever they are feeling that day.  Now it was my first visit, so I just did a bourbon cocktail and MAN.  It was spectacular.  The ingredients blended beautifully and the bartender was really cool to boot.  Drinks average $9-$12, but they are worth every penny.\n\nThe ambiance is kind of sexy: just dim enough with lots of beautiful wood tones.  There is a tv, which I noticed they had on for the Pirates playoff run.  But as soon as the game was over, that tv went off I'm glad to report!  Now there were 2 tables I noticed that had damned near spotlights directly overhead.  Sit there if you're on a date with someone you're just not so sure you'd like to see again (or with friends, since no once cares about being sexy).  \n\nThis place is connected to Legume, so while I didn't eat here I am sure the food is amazing.  I have already raved about it to several friends and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back!"
0,"This complex used to be called Haven Luxury, but has been taken over by a new management group. When the new management group took over, these apartments went to hell. I have had nothing but issues with these people. They have lost 5 of my packages in the office. When asked about them, they say to contact UPS, FedEx, etc. When said carrier tells you they don't have them and that the package was left at the office, the office staff pretty much says, \""tough sh**\"". There priorities are not in the right place. I renewed my leading agreement 11 months ago. Before I renewed, we were promised a renovated gym and laundry facilities. They said they would be ready within 4 months. Guess what, 11 months later and they just opened up the gym. The staff, for the most part is OK. It's a 50/50 chance that you will get someone who is nice and not a stuck up snob. All in all, I would say look elsewhere for a place to live. The area is nice and I have never had an issue with the folks that live around me. The staff has ruined my experience."
4,Outatanding.   Lump crab cales were all crab.  Loves the oysters.  Had swordfish and tasted Sea Bass and all was perfectly done and presentation wonderful.  Just delicious
2,"Good veggie option- except that they served me the soup with chicken so I had to send it back. Perhaps they thought that chicken must be vegetarian.. :)\nOtherwise the place had a little annoying smell - I'm very sensitive to smell - nobody else seems to have noticed it. Friend enjoyed their meals- no complaints, no big wows."
1,"I had been told this Was am amazing place by a friend w wonderful service.  However when we got there the girl at register was most unfriendly.  She would not smile at all.  I tried making small talk and she was just very cold.  I finally had to ask her if she ever smiled. She was nicer after that. \n\nThe sandwich I had was very delicious. I probably wouldn't return due to service.  The cakes they sold,  chocolates and desserts looked very yummy."
1,"There were many more positions than personnel to fill them.  We encountered an inexperienced clerk who tried to upsell us on everything imaginable.  If we hadn't been hip to the cons we'd have been totally ripped off by all the extra (unneeded) charges.  And yet, we got ripped off anyway by an outrageous fee imposed by Phoenix to pay for their new rental car palace.  Beware!  Rent off-site if you can."
0,"made the huge mistake of leaving money in the car... realized it a few minutes after I gave them the car but too late, 15.00 cars wash cost me 55.00... my fault I guess hope the slime balls have fun w my $$ but hey I have more and they don't so I win... also half ass job and NEVER get your vehicle \""detailed here!"
4,"I've seen Alegria (in Philadelphia, PA) and was pleased to see the same high quality presentation and music in O. The high-divers, cross-divers, and the guy who was chillaxing while on fire were all amazing, as were the endless list of other performers that were there.\n\nO took it to the next level with their diving pool stage/setup. Watching folks swim synchronously and never come up for air (not from this side of the pool, that is), and watching folks slowly sink into the water without a care and not come back up was as mysterious as a Cirque du Soleil show can get.\n\nO kept my attention the entire time - recommended!"
1,"this place is just okay....their renovation from Aladdin to ph seems half assed. the place is definitely marketed/pushed onto the young. they have tons of stuff going for that crowd. they have peepshow starring holly madison....which i enjoyed very much! i was kind of pissed off when i made my original review (coming from their spa experience). I do have to say i did enjoy myself here, but wasn't impressed as the higher quality hotels i have stayed at. Though they get huge points for their buffet...it is definitely one of the best i have had! I doubt I would stay here again...especially since construction is going on through las vegas blvd and this place is in the heart of it. my sister (a local) went through hell to pick me up for lunch....so that definitely sucked. my hubby and i didn't drive anywhere for fear of the mess that awaits us outside. good points were the buffet we got comped for, the coupon book, and the free bottle of booze a night promo dealie they have ( i don't drink...but chose stuff for my sister and parents). the staff here is not so great here as well...the service is not comparable to other hotels and one experience with one hotel employee kind of annoyed me. in all....an ok hotel...but nothing great or grand....there are sooo many nicer places to stay than here. it was hilarious to see all the plastered people stumble about the casino with their free booze in tow. their buffet is a must try!!!"
0,Long wait for food. Food arrived cold. Disorganized waitstaff. Nice patio but I can get that at home. Go to Firehouse Subs. It's just down the way...
2,"it's fun to come here at 2 am when other asian restaurants nearby are closed. Food was so so, some hit, some missed. A bit loud with with club music they're playing in the background. The waitresses were very nice and friendly, if it wasn't for them, i would have giving 1 less star."
1,"So I decided to bring a friend here for his birthday last night. There were four of us. Three of us ordered the Kiki's Burger, the other got the spicy miso burger. All of the burgers had good flavor. The problem is with temperature, my wife ordered hers medium rare, as she always does, but one half of the burger looked as if it had barely even touched the grill. I know raw hamburger when I see it, it was raw. The server apologized and said she would show it to the boss. She then returned and said the boss responded that my wife needs to order medium next time. I have been in the restaurant business for a long time, that is not how you respond to a complaint. They sent a complimentary desert to apologize, fine. The server then dropped the check without the burger on it, I thought that was great, I didn't ask they just made it right...WRONG! After I put the money in the check book to pay, the server returned and said \""I'm sorry, she made me add the burger back on.\"" Needless to say, I will never visit this establishment again, they treat customers wrong and I would rather spend my money where it is appreciated. I will also stop recommending it to friends, which I used to do frequently. You lost a loyal customer Bachi Burger...nice going."
2,"This restaurant has a few dishes which are vegan or can be made vegan. It has an emphasis on comfort-food type dishes, such as lentil stews with injera (a fluffy type of bread, similar to a soft South Indian dosa). I would go here if you're looking for something totally different from the usual South and East Asian vegan options in Madison."
0,"I feel bad giving this location such a low rating because like everyone in the city I know almost one person at every coffee shop here. I understand the stress of this job, but I also understand what goes on behind the counter. My husband worked at Buffalo & Lake Mead for 5 years. \n\nMy problem with this location is this. \n1) Drive thru. I refuse to go to this drive thru anymore because they simply do not follow their own policy. Starbucks has a 3 minute per car policy. Ex, if there are two cars in line, the second car should be out of the drive thru in six minutes. This location, that does not happen. I have waited over 20 minutes.... 20 minutes with one car in front. I watch to see if they are just an obnoxious person who ordered way too many drinks through the drive thru but that was not the case. Then I ask at the window you know, what happened? whats the hold up? You're not busy... They just ignore the question take my money and send me off. \n\n2) They dont understand their computers. Like I said, I have never worked at starbucks. But I know the computer just from ordering and listening to people become trained on it. I know that there is an option for milk for extra (like in a chai) or for creamer. They ALWAYS first charge me for extra soy, even though its just CREAMER. There I have to sound like the ass correcting them, but thats almost a dollar extra. They then stop and THINK about what theyre doing and act like they are new at their jobs and never were taught that. (bullshit)\n\n3) My drink is always wrong. Now I dont want to sound like one of those stuck up valley girls in all this. But my drink is probably the most simple drink ever. A venti iced coffee, with 2 pumps of white moca and some soy creamer to top it off. \npump pump, coffee, ice, milk... not hard... A standard iced coffee comes with 6 pumps of whatever you order or the standard sweetener. Its disgustingly sweet and turns into McDonalds coffee thus why I specifically one ask for 2. I always repeat myself twice, and get a repeat from them so they understood me correctly.\n\nThey still fail. Somehow I really do not realize how. \n\nMost of the people working here are little teeny boppers still in high school. Which I did think was a good job for young kids, but not here. They're ruining this location. They need better training and to work harder and faster. They do not take their job seriously.\n\nThe manager however was very kind when speaking with her. She did compliment us 2 drinks, but I will not be spending money on this location anymore. Like I said, Lake Mead & Buffalo is where it is at. \n\nI'm done ranting now."
1,Stayed at this place for a convention and  it was the cheapest place i could find so i stayed here.  As soon as i walked in the lobby i realized that this place hasn't received a decent overall since the 70s.  Walk into the elevator to find the yellow carpet halfway up the wall.  Walked into the room and it was decently sized.  Turned on the air conditioning and it sounded like a 747 was taking off.  Eventually had to sleep with the window open cause street sounds were way quieter then the sound of that ac.  Its at the very end of the strip the only thing farther was stratosphere.  Its convenient if your going to the convention center cause its only like 20mins walk from there.
1,"My husband and I were visiting Vegas for a short weekend and we decided we wanted to get some form of a massage, but didn't want to pay strip prices. I decided to make an appointment at The Foot Spa after reading all of the wonderful reviews on Yelp. The place was pretty easy to find and only a few short miles from the strip. It's located in a primarily Korean shopping center. Cool. We called ahead and made an appointment. We arrived on time and were promptly escorted to our massage area. Now, I know what I was going to be expecting at a place like this as I frequent one similar in my hometown. Every thing started off great until my massage person came in. I am solely basing this review on my massage alone, my husband enjoyed his massage very much and even feel asleep and was snoring. I'm going to start off by saying that my massage person must have just broken up with her boyfriend or something because I was basically tapped and punched through out the whole massage. I asked her to be more gentle about half way through and that lasted for about a second. My whole \""massage\"" basically went like this...tap tap tap, knead knead knead, punch punch. It was truly un-enjoyable and almost unbearable at times...I would have tenderized a piece of meat more gently than the massage I was given. The guy at my nail salon gives a better FREE neck and shoulder massage for 10 minutes than this place. \""Sorely\"" disappointed. Pun intended."
1,"I LOVE RH, as in LOVE. I was extremely excited to visit this location but unfortunately, my excitement quickly disappeared when I experienced the customer service. I asked for pricing on an outdoor model ( I had to wait 20 minutes to be helped), my question was answered quickly, when I proceeded to ask for pricing on three other pieces ( I knew were they were in the store and their characteristics), I was asked if I could be sent an email with the information.\n\nThe representative looked as if he was in a hurry and I was so disgusted with the way he replied and the lack of interest he had in me as a customer I just wanted to leave. I gave him my information, cell phone, and email, he said he would send it later that day.... I has been a week. \n\nI was planning on purchasing the pieces that day once I knew the final price but the representative assumed that after having waited so long to be helped, I could wait even longer for a reply.\n\nRH... your prices are not a crate and barrel or pottery barn or ikea for that matter.  I have gone to ikea to buy a 20 dollar lamp and have been treated 100 times better than when I wanted to buy a 3500 usd couch at your store.\n\nRH strives to continue to be a luxury brand and your design and quality is superb. Please, have your customer service be up to par with what you are selling."
3,"Great attention!!! I'm not into expensive make up or much of facial painting, but had to buy a gift for a MAC Fan. The variety of colors adjust more the pale skin than mine. Anyway you can get to try and open all those pots and lip gloss tubes! Enjoy!"
1,"Disappointed!  From the Yelp rating and the looks of the place I thought it was a diamond in the rough.  This could be my neighborhood go-to pizza joint, I thought!  There were some questionable comments in the reviews but I thought maybe if I get the carryout, it is better than the slices served there?\n\nThe pizza was underwhelming.  Although the toppings were good, sauce and crust was ok, it was very much like a homemade copycat version of Tombstone pizza.  However, at 2.50 vs 18 per pie, might as well stock up on the frozen version.\n\nThe chicken wings were pretty soggy and had lots of thick skin on it.  If you like that kind of thing, go for it.  Me, I would rather not.\n\nI wish I could have liked it a little better, they seemed very nice and I like local businesses.  :/"
1,"Cheba Hut. I think this place is okay. The pokalolo was my favorite sandwich. I have gone into this place many times, but always felt like something was either missing or needed to change. I don't think I ever really picked up on what that thing was. I will say that there is a lot of people who love this place. \n\nI think it is a bit overrated and got tired of the whole weed theme behind it. I also felt slightly disgusted by some of the people who made my sandwiches there (taking a shower is too mainstream for some of them)."
4,"Living in Vegas you don't always seem to find the best of the best when it comes to people truly caring about the profession they've chosen.  This is certainly NOT the case when it comes to Willis from Joshua Ian Photography !!  I have used his services twice in the past and not only have I been thrilled with his expertise, but the photos that I received have impressed guests at my home when browsing through the \""family wall of fame !!\"" Willis is spiritually gifted !! It doesn't get any better than that !!  He has a true eye for photography and you will be pleasantly surprised when he can create scenarios for your special event that you've never thought of !!!  Whether it be a wedding, a special birthday, or, in my case, a surprise gift for a very special niece, Willis takes your occasion to a whole new level.  If you are looking for a photographer for ANY special event, look no further.  Willis from Joshua Ian Photography is truly the man for your special day !!!"

0,I sent an email thru the Mastro website to let them know I got food poisoning at one of their restaurants. No response from them yet. I guess the restaurant doesn't care about their customers...
0,"Tried to kick smoking, went to High Life to buy what I needed for vaping  Felt decent about the purchase, but not good about the experience.  After arriving home and looking at other local stores I noticed I overpaid, and was sold knock offs.  The first battery never held a charge and the charger I bought was defective as well.  I tested each product independently.  Upon trying to return the broken merchandise within 24 hours, they offered no return nor exchange.  All sales final.  Fine, I get it.  Fool me.  A company that can't even stand by the products they sell is a fraud, cause the products are junk.  Also the knock off equipment could have exploded and caused great harm to my home or person.  A cheap battery from an unregulated plant could overheat, explode in hand make me a lefty for life.  A defective charger could start a fire in my home and kill everyone nestled in their beds.  Go somewhere that cares about you, the community and proper business ethics.  I understand profit, and bottom line, but I dont support taking advantage of uninformed customers.  This is not a vent, just an event log so you can make an informed decision.  Dont believe me, fine, read the other reviews, everybody seems real happy with this establishment."
1,While the food was of great quality and the staff were friendly. I take off 3 stars for the following reasons: \n\n1. Staff member observed leaving huge pile of ice mess on the floor after finishing transferring ice from the ice maker to the soda fountain ice bin. Staff member didn't bother cleaning up after herself! (ya mommy don't work there with you.. clean up your own mess!!). \n\n2. Buffet serving area didn't appear to been recently cleaned. Utensils felt sticky to the hand and floors not recently mopped (floors felt sticky as well.. including the restrooms). \n\n3. Been there 2 separate times and each time had to ask for silverware so I could eat my food! (make it a habit to bring the silverware out with the bowl or something!!).
0,"I am a longtime shopper at buffalo exchange and I must say, this location is terrible. Staff is unfriendly, selection is awful & they never seem to buy any of the quality clothing that I bring in. I am done shopping here, completely over it."
2,"I went with a buddy who swears by the cheesesteaks. I opted for a turkey sandwich with coleslaw and swiss. I will say I was impressed that they roast whole turkeys here for the sandwicehs, so no thin processed turkey on teh sandwich. I would prefer if they baked their own bread, but that's not a huge deal. I ordered the \""small\"" sandwich, that was stil huge! all in all, good turkey sandwich"
2,"Pineapple Carrot Cake is very good here. Even after eating it two days later, it was still moist, not ruined with raisins (can't stand cooked raisins, eeewww), and the pineapple really finishes it. I always make my carrot cake with pineapple, so that will always win me over. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=UARGXxOFHv2DM7NZe6Ac-A\n\nIf you stop for the BLT bloody mary on the way home, you can pick up a snack here for the drive. Plenty of desserts http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=-aEM8ucFmzvvlVCt8RiaYw, but also sandwiches, scones, coffee, and even gelato! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6qKhUQwyMLBl9ehwB-cfxQ?select=Kih_XQhOBdSVZe4ph3oHXQ"
2,"Most of the staff are friendly and helpful and the store offers a lot of different services, including key cutting, mailbox rentals, and photo-copying, though it is a very small shop.\n\nI have a mailbox here and fairly consistently get mail that's supposed to go to an adjacent box.  When I report it, they always say they'll ask the distributor to be more careful, but I can't say I've noticed much change.  I wonder how much mail of mine has gone to another box?\n\nThe main complaint I have relates to the cost of mail services.  GASP!!  Holy crap!!!  Be prepared to pay a premium.  They are overpriced, as also noted by several other reviewers.\n\nTIP: For US Postal Service in the same shopping center, visit the Hallmark Store to the west.  They store itself has the worst service ever (see my review), but they have an in-store postal branch outlet...at least for now.  That may change when the USPS goes belly-up..."
2,"With all of the talk about this place we had to go here while visiting Edinburgh from the US. As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \""benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \n\nWent there for lunch....results:\n\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \n\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\n\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\n\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\n\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\n\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding. Would go there again for dinner because this place is so special but with the hope of a better food experience.\n\nI"

4,DA BOMB!
3,"Well done! Had a delicious, full of flavor dinner and great customer service. We will be coming back"
2,Decent.
0,I would have rather stayed at the super 8 motel than this place ever again. I stayed here 3 years ago ANC the room itself was dirty and there was a unidentified red streak in the wall that looked like blood. It never rains in Vegas but the one time it did was when we were staying here and it was the most rainfall recorded in years... The room 2 doors down's ceiling collapsed and the whole floor smelled like mildew. Not one person checked up on us or anything and when we said something about the smell the didn't move us or anything. I will never stay here again and will tell everyone else not to either.
3,"I was FINALLY able to try the famous Burgatory here in Pittsburgh!\n\nSome of my first thoughts--very cool looking place! I love the walls and decorations they have around the joint. The bar is also very contemporary and sits nicely in the restaurant.\n\nThe burgers? Good--but I have to report (sadly) that I was a bit underwhelmed. Perhaps it's because there has been so much hype about these places and from my friends that I thought that the burger would have just blown me away. I had a milkshake for desert. Spiked was a little too rich I thought.\n\nIs it worth it? Sure, but not for a 30 minute plus wait. Come check it out for yourself!"
2,"I was just thinking that if I checked in to this business enough I could be the Duke of Earl of Sandwich, which would be probably the best royal title mashup ever. \n\nRandom musings aside, I have to say that I must be missing whatever the hype is about this place. I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am. At no time, sober or un-sober, was I really in any way impressed by these sandwiches. This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I'd take this any day over a McDonald's burger or similar. And compared to the vast array of gross casual food served on the strip, this is a step above. But I simply didn't encounter anything close to the 4- and -star raves people are heaping upon this joint. \n\nThe highlights include that the prices are totally reasonable for this part of town, and the tortilla soup is actually pretty good. But my caesar salad had some slimy brown lettuce mix in the midst of the rest of the sturdy romaine, and both of the greasy sandos I sampled were simply that. Greasy and salty and just okay. \n\nFor where it's at, I give it three stars. Anywhere else? I'd probably choose something with more flavor."
4,"There really isn't much more to say, because you can see how awesome this place is from my original review. Or from the reviews of others.\n\nI came in for the Yelp Eats UYE, and went to town by crushing some mad food.\n\nOn this particular night, I had the Yellowtail Sashimi, Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Soft Shell Crab Sandwich, and for dessert, another appetizer....the Teeter Tots. Yes, two entrees, and an appetizer for dessert. It was that damn good.\n\nDon't waste time reading any more reviews. Just go. Nobuo. Now."
3,"Oysters.  That's all there is to it, 15 deep fried oysters.  That is all I want, that is all I order.\n\nOf all the P* Fish and Chips, this breading is the thinnest... I was thinking it was all pre-fabbed, but now reading Jared A's review, perhaps the secret is hand breading!"
3,Above average for airport food.   The service was friendly and the food was fresh.   The eating area needed a good cleaning.    A free to cookie to finish off the meal......better then expected.
4,"Two words: HELLA GOOD. Wish we had one of these in Oregon! Visited in October while on a business trip. So glad we chose this place over the pho place a few doors down. Nothing against the one a few doors down, I have never been there but EVERYTHING about our experience at Pho Kim Long was awesome. We chose this place over the other solely because the name was too awesome to pass up and I couldn't resist a check-in on Facebook.\n\nEverything from our appetizer to the dessert was amazing. We started with the Calamari which my mouth is watering for as I write this review two months later. Very salty but nothing wrong with that! Next up for me was the pho which is hard to screw up but surprisingly some places in Oregon do. It was spot on- perfect flavor. For dessert we had the pineapple half with ice cream. The ice cream could have been served a little but it was still great.\n\nTo top it all off our server was one of the most friendly servers I've had. I believe he said it was only his second day working there. He did an outstanding job and was very personable. The whole family left very satisfied!"
4,"French cooking with some interesting fusions going on, Passion8 is one of the best restaurants in the metro.  Fois Gras that is expertly made without being cloying or compromising, lamb and duck just as you'd find them on the Right Bank, and an impressive beer and wine list make this a great date night/business meeting location."
0,"The selection here sucks. This one is pretty much just a kids store. The only items that were really offered to women were just a few tank tops, and some work out clothes. There was nothing cute. I generally don't shop here, but I went in one day to buy a few gifts for my cousins since they shop here often, and I was not impressed at all. The lines are very long too. I waited for a good chunk of time only to purchase a few items."
0,"Upon entering Riazzi's, Kevin and I were unsure if we had stepped into an Italian restaurant or a nursing home. The patterns on the carpet and booths were horrifyingly dated, and the place was dingy and dark. The only thing that kept me from whole heartedly believing that we were visiting my great grandmother's home was the waiters/waitresses/bus boys playing Rhianna full blast in the kitchen as they talked loudly about their personal lives and friend drama and hair cuts. Food was fine. Nothing to write home about. But the atmosphere, oh gosh. Never again."
1,"2 stars is being generous. 1 star is for a great location in Old Montreal and the other star is because my wife likes their salt and pepper chicken wings.\nIt fails at being a sports bar. Sure they show a few games but they simultaneously pipe in Whitney Houston and Celine Dion greatest hits over the sound system.\nFood has no imagination, variety or taste.\nService and management are very weak.\nHave had several issues over the 5 times that I have been there with no satisfactory resolutions.\nWaste of a great location in Le Vieux Port!"
1,"Good food - straightforward, good fresh local ingredients, non chi-chi plates, and a very nice space in a great neighborhood. \nHOWEVER, after my 3rd visit, I decided that the food wasn't good enough to make me want to put up with the *abominable* service.  No more E2 for me: I've had enough of the waiters with attitude (one nice guy - none of the others were anything but extremely rude), hostess who makes it clear what an honor it is that she is paying any attention to you, and whomever answers the phone should be fired - she scares the customers away."
2,I haven't seen one of these in quite a while.  They still have great fresh bagels.
2,"A well themed resort with mediocre service.\n\n***ROOM***\nI was happy with our pool-view room in the Casino tower. Our standard room was pretty spacious (500 sq. ft.?) with a few noteworthy amenities: an iHome and a bed as fluffy as clouds. The room could have skipped out on the portrait of some rockstar, who kept freaking me out each time I caught a glimpse of it.\n\nWe booked the place with the intention to recuperate from our weekend at EDC. Instead, I felt like we were part of the Rehab party. We were fine with that too... it kept the party going. Even with our balcony door closed, we could still feel the vibration of the bass from the pool party. :)\n\n***SERVICE***\nBefore even entering our rooms, I had already received subpar service --\nMy hotel package came with a comp bottle of hard A + $40 food and drink credit. While checking in, the receptionist was ready to send me on my merry way with just the room keys, until I had to ask for my vouchers. Though he corrected the mistake, he seemed the least bit apologetic, and even judgmental, like I was freeloading off them... um no! just asking for what I paid! I would not even have to ask if I had received it in the first place!\n\nThe second day, we slept through \""Tidy Up\"" time, so I called Guest Services to replenish our tissues, amenities, and towels stock later that night. Housekeeping came 10 minutes later with towels, and a bag with two sets of amenities, but minus the soap. I never saw the box of tissues either D: I guess I'll be better prepared with my own amenities next time. \n\n***OVERALL*** \nGreat view of the pool and back of the strip, especially at night, but this is the last time I am booking a standard room here on my own free will. I would be open to staying at a HRH Tower Suite on a future visit. From pictures, the Suite looks similar to the ones at Vdara. \n\nNote: Stay away from this resort if you are looking for peace and quiet  in Vegas. :)"
1,"I really liked the outdoor area and the view, but that's about it.  It was very odd walking though an office space to get there, and there's not much else around it once you get there.  I'm not sure if it's still considered uptown, but it's fairly close if you're okay with driving from center city.\n\nAnyway, It was pretty empty when we went and the decor was okay.  I'll likely visit again soon this summer to take advantage of the patio...but there are several other places I'll go to first.\n\nBTW...the drinks are pretty good...service was kinda bland tho :-/"
4,"I arranged my shuttle service via the Internet.  They were prompt, friendly, the van was clean and cool.  They helped me with my bag.  I enjoy the Super Shuttle and have used them several times.  Really enjoy setting up the pickup via the Internet.  I can pay for the trip and the tip, so I don't need to worry about money when I'm getting dropped off!  Convenient!"
0,"I was a long time and loyal customer after I moved to Vegas 2 1/2 years ago and I went to this restaurant numerous times until when I start seem HUGE cockroaches. First time was my ex boyfriend came to visit so I intent to gave him a better impression after he dumped me so we sat at the sushi bar then he pointed at the wall and show me the HUGE cockroaches walking on the wall slowly across the bar, I was so stun but since I was such a LOYAL customer, I did not mentioned to the owner. I mentioned to the owner next time when I was there then the owner just looked at me for couple minutes and saying if NEXT TIME if I happen to see again, he will give me 10% off. WHAT?  NEXT TIME? he forgot how many times I already been there after all these 2 1/2 years? I mentioned to another management next time and got the same respond. I decide not to go this restaurant anymore. 1 month ago, I brought one of my new friend there for lunch then we saw the cockroaches again. I mentioned to the server that the reason I stop coming here because the cockroaches and now here's again and the owner's attitude. She did not do anything either. Couple days ago, I went to the restaurant tried to order the lunch special and I got there at 5PM sharp and the owner was calculating the total bill for the others and not even look me for a second, after couple minutes passed, he said the lunch was over at 5PM but I got there at 5PM, he did not even look at me. \n\nI swear in my life that I would NEVER going to step into this restaurant again after I waste my life at here for more then 2 years. Isn't the customer service most important for the Japanese restaurant?\n\nIt's a pricy place and noisy and crowed place, just not sure why so many people go there for? You won't have a quality time for easily paying over $80+ for 2 people. The moist important is there's no SERVICE at all. The owner's attitude is even worth to hell. Don't get me wrong, I already ordered lunch special for over 50 times and their food has no problem at all but the owner is that kind of person since he sees so many customer coming up to the store, he forgot what's called SERVICE and APPRECIATION. He's taking for granted especially for a long term customer. \n\nNot only this restaurant is dirty, noisy and crowed and you have to wait for at least 1 hour in the night and also you will for sure join the dinner with the other insects if you are still want to go. Good luck for the people who still going.\n\nI am terribly upset right now when I am writing this post. I wish I had never spend that much money & time to this restaurant in my life."
0,"I chose not to get a tattoo here after my experience during the consultation. I set up an appointment in advance but when I came to my appointment I was told the person was busy with another appointment. I waited until that appointment was over and then I met with the artist. I explained to her I wanted a tattoo on my right leg and she told me the leg would be too painful to do. I already had a tattoo on my left leg, so I did not see what the problem was? A leg tattoo has not hurt me any different from any of my other tattoos. It just seemed like the artist was trying to make excuses to not do my tattoo. In general, it seemed like the tattoo shop had 2 receptionists working and neither of them addressed me when I walked in or offered to help me in any way. I had to approach them to ask about my appointment and how much longer the wait would be, since obviously making an appointment did not seem to guarantee anyone would see me.But the ultimate reason I chose not to continue to work with the artist there, besides her telling me she couldn't do a tattoo on my leg, was because she suggested to me that I should get liposuction. She said it would be a better investment for me to pay for plastic surgery rather than get a tattoo and that I should consider losing some weight before I get any tattoos. I am an average sized person - I would not consider myself overweight and I was insulted she would tell me that I need to get liposuction before she would tattoo me. Customer service is not a priority at Club Tattoo. And my experience with this artist has made me not want to go to any Club Tattoo location for future work."
4,"First time to the Pizza Company while on a business trip on a Friday for the local Arms Gun show.\n\nHad a 12\"" margherita pizza and had them add a few mushrooms (small up-charge on price), as well.\n\nNoticed on the Yelp photos that the pizza were not \""burnt\""...so I knew to ask the staff to burn mine a bit.\n\nPizza is just not pizza unless you have some charring at the perimeter and the bottom of the crust.  It ads that burnt, smoked taste.\n\nThe crushed tomato sauce was excellent, fresh cheese and mushrooms are also excellent.  Basil is added the pizza comes out of the oven.\n\nPizza was great.  I did a take-out and walked the 2-3 minutes back to the nearby Hampton Inn.\n\nStaff was very friendly and wanted to make sure they did it right.  Before my pizza was boxed, they had me look it over.\n\nThe place is quaint, smallish..but they have enough seating for 20+ folks.  Clean and charming and quiet enough to have friends and be able to hear to talk.\n\nAlso got a piece of their tiramisu cake...which was also very, very good.  I let it come to room temp. before eating it.\n\nWhen back in Las Vegas, I will make the Pizza Co. my place for pizza cravings !"
2,"This was a funny place to end up on a night out with sixty (and then some) co-workers from our Amsterdam office. It was not beautiful but it was fun to go to with such a big group of different people. Very accessible, love the music. Ceiling's to low. Or maybe us dutchies are too tall. Either way; funny place! \u00a310 is a reasonable entrancw price (allthough we spent a sh*tload of money the night before, how about some discount next time?)"
3,"I first want to start out by saying I love First Watch. I was always reluctant to try it but after the first time I met my soon to be mom in law there for lunch I was hooked. Before I seriously started watching my weight I would usually get the ham and cheese to the fifth degree and the tomato soup combo. *HOLY CHEESY FOODGASM IN MY MOUTH* it is to die for. Although it isn't printed on the menu anymore you can still ask for it and they will make it. Now when we go I order the Power Wrap (which is on the lighter side menu) I never knew egg whites, spinach, turkey, and Swiss cheese topped with salsa could be so damn good. Their mango iced tea is awesome as well. As for the establishment it's self it is always clean. The staff is typically pretty friendly and accommodating. I almost want to give them 5 stars but I do believe some improvements could be made to better some of their menu items. So I'll give it 4 stars... Yay! I'm a fan."
1,"So I drive by this place a few times a week, and after seeing their cheesy commercials I've decided to give this place a try. I would not recommend their pizza at all. I had the California Pizza which includes your typical pizza veggies, and I have to say...NO FLAVOR at ALL!!! Even with added salt and pepper..no flavor!!! This was the first time coming here after being in AZ for 2 years...and will be my LAST!!!"
4,"by far the BEST thai food i've ever had. it brings shame to any thai bbq and sanamluang locations. the food screams authenticity and different flavors associated with thai cooking - yes, there is more than lemon grass, coconut milk, and curry powder! there are levels of spiciness and the owner is a connoisseur of german white wines. he can match any dish with the right wine. how superb! just make sure you know what you are asking for when you ask for \""spicy\"". dinner is the best deal. for lunch, there is a buffet, however, it rids of the entire atmosphere. (if you want a buffet in vegas, eat at the rio!) there are tons and tons of items to try- all the more reason to come back. i think we ordered about 7-8 dishes and paid a little over 100, including tax and tip. we were only a party of 3! now that is good dining!\r\n\r\nthe location and the setting isnt what you would expect of the restuarant. it's off the strip (which is a good and bad thing), located in a plaza. just dont judge a book by its cover. come hungry and talk to the owner if he's there. he's a really nice guy!"
1,"Same red/white colors as in-n-out however twice the price and half the flavor...very disappointing and i'm not even a fan of in-n-out.\n\nFor that kind of pricing model, you are better off going to Delux, Red Robin, Blu Burger or actually any restaurant or dive bar and you will get a better burger for the same price."
3,"I'm an out-of-towner, but when I'm in Squirrel Hill, I always make sure to stop here for a egg sandwich and a few bagels to go. The super cinnamon and the whole wheat are particularly lovely."
3,"Met a colleague for lunch here the other day.  Decided to order the Club Sandwich w/Fries, $11.  He warned me that they don't mess around with their portion size....he was right.  This Sandwich was huge!  In addition to that, it comes with a large pile of skinny Fries.  The Club Sandwich was very good.....and the Fries were outstanding.  I could eat a large plate of those Fries.\n\nThe service was great as well.  Overall, a pleasant \""working\"" lunch experience.\n\nReturn Factor - 90%"
3,"Athenian Express has a HUGE selection of things to chose from. They have salads, burgers, gyros, pasta, subs, and pitas! There are also LOTS of vegetarian items.\nTheir hummus is out of this world. They make it fresh every morning and it comes with a generous helping of their pita that they get flown in from chicago because it's some of the best pita in the country.\nI've had lots of different things on their menu and I liked each and every thing I've tried. Sometimes their fries are a little over cooked and under salted but whatever, I don't go there for the fries.\nThe gyros are great, so are their pitas. My favorite pita is the chicken picado. The chicken is always very juicy and fresh and the grilled vegetables are well cooked and pair well with the chicken.\nI know they're also doing breakfast now, which I have had once. I don't remember what I got because it was some years ago, but I remember leaving satisfied and full.\n\nI think for the price and quality, you just can't beat Athenian express. For a year, I worked right next door to them. I would stop in almost every day and get lunch and talk with the owner and his wife. They are very friendly and funny, as is their staff. I always felt welcomed. Even with phones ringing off the hook and lines out the door, they always have a smile on their faces.\nI stop in maybe once every 3 months or so and the only thing that's changed since I worked next to them is that they've renovated and made the place bigger. Some people might not like that, but they generate way too much business and they really needed the extra seating area.\n\nI love Athenian Express, and their employees. It's a hidden gem that I'm glad I found."
3,"Love Mongolian BBQ, Love this place.  Everything is always fresh and has the best varitey of any I have been to.  Would have given it 5 stars if they had the traditional sesame and other cool oils...."
2,"I think I need to go in during the mornings to see the best selection of cupcakes. The times I've come here have been toward the end of the day and they don't have much left. That being said, I did try their butterfinger cupcake and it was pretty good. There is more frosting than cupcake, and I'm not wild about globs of frosting, but if you're a frosting lover and a cake hater, you'll be stoked on the proportions."
2,"Braddock is your typical hotel restaurant in a nice downtown hotel.  Very nicely decorated with good service but the food is a bit overpriced for what you pay.  We ate here several times while staying at the Renaissance over the weekend since it's conveniently located inside the hotel.\n\nThe breakfast buffet here is $15/person and does not quite worth its value.  It's basically $15 for a continental breakfast with some hot items (eggs, bacon).  Lunch/dinner here is similar to your average American restaurant with burgers and sandwiches.  The service though is great and our waitress was very attentive to our needs.  For a hotel restaurant in a city downtown, expect the typical American grill.  Within walking distances are many more options so try something different unless you're looking for the convenience of a hotel restaurant."
3,"Spinach salad is a must try.  Pad thai is good, not as good as Lotus of Siam.  Pad see ew tastes similar to Pin Kaow.  Really good thai iced tea.  Pricier than most thai restaurants.\n\nService is good and fast.  Decor is lovely.  I will probably go once in a while but since Pin Kaow is nearby, this will not be a regular place for me."
0,"Kitchen is great but watch out for the bar.  They only comp your drinks if you LOSE.  James Aguilar, (manager) NOT customer friendly, does NOT give a crap about locals.\nCame in here with my husband whom was gambling a little. Ate, played pool... ZERO beers comped.. We only hoped for one to be comped, but these guys were totally hard up.\nApparently PTs is hurtin for money if they won't comp ONE draft beer.\nNever going back.\nAlso put $5 in the juke box.\n\nWe are all around good patrons usually, but not used to the \""you don't lose enough here\"" motto.  Weird vibe. \nTake my advice... Go across the street to Eureka Casino.. Barry and Grace are so nice, and Fat Choy has a better menu."
0,"another review for maybe a second chance to do good. i ordered the reuben sandwich for a late night craving. the meat was so thinly slices that the sandwich was just bland. best part of the meal, Susan. she was making sure that my meal was perfect but you can't blame her for the food being soso. total cost for the coffee and sandwich $19. are you kidding me."
2,"RA seemed like a legit sushi restaurant while we were sitting in our hotel room, craving sushi. We opted to wait a bit and head over to catch their reverse happy hour (10 pm-close). The interior is nicely dimmed and has a cozy feeling. There was a good vibe in there and thank god it was not noisy and hectic. Getting away from the crazy loud Vegas life to enjoy a meal was refreshing.\n\nOrdered off the happy hour menu. Wasn't too impressed with what I saw on there so I figured I'll go with what I know and keep it decent. From what I saw around my table, rolls were slightly small, my rainbow roll was just okay. The albacore was probably the best dish I sampled. Honestly, nothing was too memorable for me and same goes for my friends.\n\nOn  a good note... service was phenomenal, even hooked me up with a sake on the house. BUT, their idea of a large sake, is weaaaaaakkk. That's a small ass bottle my friend. A quiet, chill, not too stuffed but sorta buzzed evening gives my experience at RA a solid 3 stars."
2,"Been here a few times and can only rate it as OK. The service has always been good and the food on the mediocre side. The best I have had are the noodle dishes but if you are a sushi fan you will be let down. Sure, if you are looking to do some serious drinking and need some sushi to chase your saki then this is a fun place. But for serious sushi others in the valley are going to be worth the drive. Read Roka Akor."
2,"Don Pedro's is a good spot.  Probably the best Mexican I've had in this little area so far.  Their lunch specials are really affordable, most are $5.95 and they serve salsa and pico de gallo with their chips.  Yum!  The wait staff is friendly and quick and they wear little Spaniard-esque uniforms.  I had a chicken enchilada and chicken taco combo and was satisfied with the selection.  At the end of the meal they brought out some type of cinnamon/raspberry sauce giant chip with whip cream on top.  Nice little meal ending surprise."
1,"I'm not rating the product, only the customer service level of the older gentleman (owner/worker) not sure of their status. I took my daughter since she wanted to see what they carried, since I boosted about this market. We were both very impressed and decided that this is where we will start purchasing most of our meats. However, the only thing that they do not carry, that my daughter loves are turkey chops. That will not be a problem. We didn't really make a purchase other than some cheese, that looked wonderful and I just had to try it. A little over $3 and I used my debit card. This gentleman with no personality, took my card that I handed to him. (Key words: \"" I handed ). Rang my total and place my card on the counter. (Dear Lord, that makes my blood boil, hair stand on the back of my neck, eyes bleed). You know what I'm talking about. Placed my receipt on the counter for my signature. Took the receipt, no eye contact, placed in the drawer and never said \""thank you\"" \""come again\"" \""hit the road\""...nothing! I am going to try them again. I can assure you when it comes to customer service, \""3 strikes, you're out\"", does not apply here. They will get one more chance. What's more annoying is that I have told several people about this market and each person has gone, made a purchase and loves the product. Maybe they should keep personality-less in the back and not have customer contact."
4,"Great spot for the atmosphere, and absolutely fantastic coffee. The Food is wonderful. Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"In the past I had tried another place to have some parts re-chromed. 6 weeks later, they hadn't even started the job, so I was willing to try Papago because of my horrible experience with the other spot. This was slightly better, but not by far. I am starting to realize that this type of business plays by it's own rules... Deadline is an unknown word, and on time is a foreign concept. Work was supposed to due on the 20th, and on the 2nd of the next month, I picked up the item the day they called and said it was ready. To boot, the item looked really crappy. The front office was filthy, like it hadn't been cleaned in... OK... Looked like it had never been cleaned. Ever. So, if anyone knows a place for re-chroming, that is reliable, on time, and does a good job, let me know. I'm not holding my breathe!"
0,"Wow!  The worst bottle service experience of my life, in Vegas or otherwise.  Not at all what I expected from this place given all the hype.\n\nWe had a table reservation for a group of five guys and two girls with a $3000 minimum.  We arrived around midnight and were seated pretty promptly at a prime dance floor table, as we expected for the amount we paid on a regular Friday night.  \n\nThe table next to us was crowded with girls and only girls - most of them hot local girls.  They were drinking for free from the cheapest bottles and were clearly \""employed\"" by the club, whether they were actually paid or simply lured by free bottles.  This fact became even more evident when we ordered our champagne and vodka and the bottle waitress pointed over to the girls' table and told us that if we see any we like we should point them out and she would bring them over.  It's standard practice in Las Vegas for staff members to bring girls to tables, but I found taking it to this level quite hilarious; regardless, props to them if it works as a business model.\n\nA little later on in the night, after having chatted with one of the girls from the pro-clubber table, her group of friends was sent off (sold?) to another big spending table. I decided to take the waitress up on her earlier offer to send ladies over.  At this point, to reach our $3000 minimum, we had purchased several bottles of vodka and champagne, much of which was still on our table unopened.  I asked the waitress about sending some girls over, and she replied, in the rudest manner I've ever experienced at a nightclub, \""You're drinking Stoli.  Girls aren't attracted to Stoli.  You should order something else if you want girls to come to your table.\""\n\nLuckily, it wasn't tough to find girls (she was quite wrong about girls and their attraction to Stoli), but this level of attitude is hardly what I would expect from someone set to make a minimum $750 gratuity from serving a single table.  This would never happen at a true top-tier club. I'll stick to XS and Marquee from now on."
3,I've been here for lunch a couple times and decided to check out their happy hour.\n\nSitting in the bar area they offer a limited food menu at great prices.  We ordered the fries and chicken wings.  The fries came with three dipping sauces and all three were good.  The wings were meaty and seasoned very well.\n\nI enjoyed a Kiltlifter beer in the bottle.\n\nNext time I want to try one of their flatbread pizzas.
2,3.5 Stars\n\nThe food was better than okay and had me wanting to come back to explore their menu.  The corn beef hash took a minute but was definitely worth the wait.  \n\nWill definitely be back the next time we're in Vegas.
0,Needed something cheap and quick to eat.. decided on this and it was a bad decision. It looks like Panda Express but tastes nothing compared to it. Had a funky sour taste. \n\nNot a fan.
0,"Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.\nI have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them, which has been about 3 years.  My internet will be slow for no reason atleast once a week, my cable will freeze and I will have to restart my box...which is annoying when you are trying to watch tv.\n\nAlso, they really have the worst customer service I have ever dealt with. I recieved a bill from them a YEAR AND HALF after the fact for 35 bucks.  The best part is, I do not even have time warner in my name anymore....when I asked why I got this bill so late, they told me that since I moved they no longer had a \""bill to\"" address.\n\nhmm, very odd that no other companies had any issues with sending mail to my new address.  Its also extremely odd that they could not contact me via e-mail or telephone? Would that have been so difficult? I dont think so.\n\nI called them up to discuss his and ask them these questions and the person I spoke to was dumbfounded.  Yea, I would be to.....because it makes NO SENSE TO BILL SOMEONE A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND THE FIRST TIME THEY SEE THE BILL IS WHEN IT IS SENT TO THEM A YEAR AND A HALF LATER.\n\nDo yourself a favor, take to look into another internet/cable provider.  It is not worth the hassel or the headache."
0,"I went here for a coworker's birthday and was highly disappointed. The other reviews on the restaurant were great so my expectations were a little high. The ambiance of the restaurant is fantastic with the spectacular views but the food and service left much to be desired. I work in the service industry so tend to be a little less critical but I was incredibly disappointed in Binions. \n\nWhile our group was sitting down, one member (who happened to be visiting from another country) stood next to the window to take pictures and our server hovered over our table trying to take drink orders. He was clearly annoyed because she wasn't paying attention and he had to wait. We were there around 8:30 and there were maybe 3 other couples in the restaurant so it's not like he was that busy...I don't quite understand why he didn't step away and give us a few minutes to settle in before taking drink orders.\n\nNow on to the food...I don't eat red meat so I can't speak for the steak but the seafood was awful. I'm from Seattle so have a taste for good, fresh fish and this restaurant did not have it. I ordered the seared ahi tuna and when the plate was set down in front of me, the first thing I saw was two slabs of gray meat. I kid you not, it looked like liver. Unfortunately for me it tasted as bad as it looked: dry and bland. And the sauce they chose? Yeah...it did not compliment it at all. The garlic mashed potatoes were okay but didn't hold a candle to The Keg's. \n\nMaybe it was an off night for Binion's but this was my first impression and with that being said, I'll never go back. The way I see it, they should treat every customer's experience like it's their first and \""wow\"" them so they'll come back. Unfortunately, I was not \""wow'd\"" and don't plan on visiting Binon's again."
0,"Attended a wedding at Seville Golf and Country Club.  The Doubletree provided a shuttle to the event and also scheduled a pickup immediately following the event.  On our way the driver didn't provide professional customer service ( didn't help us out of the van).  At the conclusion the ride was over 2 hours late.  We had to call multiple times, very disappointed in the service."
4,"This place is so good.  The food is wonderful, the employees all know me by name, the atmosphere is laid back.  I love to go for breakfast, where my grandson and I can enjoy the geese and the other wildlife on the lake, the atmosphere is very peaceful, allowing for a great place to take a bunch of friends and actually be able to hear each while we enjoy great meals, and their specials are always tasty.  My only dislike ever, was their pasta, and that's a personal sauce preference."
2,"We arrived here for Brunch on a Saturday afternoon. There was no wait to pay for the buffet but we waited about 40 minutes to be seated. That was somewhat frustrating as you could see empty tables in the dining room.\n\nThis place is hyped up by fellow Yelpers & foodies, but I don't know that it's the best buffet in Vegas. I would say it's on the same level as the Wynn and a step below Bacchanal.\n\nThe food isn't bad, but it could have been better. I wasn't able to fully satisfy my intense pig-out session, because personally, I didn't see that many foods that I wanted to reach for. They had all the basics like meats, pasta, dessert, etc but nothing too exciting."
4,I love this place!  The people that run this join are top notch!  When I visit Pittsburgh I love to go to the Cantina.  Yinz should get down on it.
4,"Mandalay Bay is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas. I love it because they have my favorite room - the two bedroom X3 suite. I typically have a lot of girls in my group and that means we need more than one bathroom. The X3 has a king bed in one bedroom and two queen beds in another. Each large bedroom has a huge bedroom with two sinks. That's 4 sinks in the joint. This suite accommodates 6 girls very comfortably. Last trip, we had 8 ladies in the group so I booked the GR suite next door and it was a perfect for us to have the entire corner of the floor. \n\nI also love the pool area. I prefer a bungalow or a cabana, but the regular areas are great too. \n\nI used to live in Las Vegas and have a lot of friends that still live there. Mandalay Bay is conveniently located at the end of the strip by the airport and Town Square. My friends can easily pick me up without battling the entire length of the strip. \n\nI wish they had some nightlife. When is Rum Jungle going to be redone?"
0,"We have not been to native in quiet a long time.  We decided to go to here and the service was horrible.  The food was just ok.  We tried to mention to the manage of the bad service and it seem to go in one ear and out the other.  The bar area is very loud and the bartender and service in the bar area was aweful.  They are very rude and just seem very uninterested in waiting on tables.  I would rather make the drive elsewhere to have better service than at this place!  If you can avoid it, that would be my suggestion."
0,"In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest. Unfortunately the playing area was just horrible."
4,"If you're planning to do a dinner and show here in Vegas, then the KA and Craftsteak package is the way to go. ($175-$199 PP). Show tickets themselves are around $125-$150. \n\nCraftsteak was simply amazing. The stars speak for themselves. We had:\n\nAppetizers\nGrilled Quail\nRoasted Red Reppers\nMixed Lettuces\n\nEntrees\nHangar Steak (shared)- get it medium\nRoasted Chicken - juicy juicy juicy\nDiver Sea Scallops \n\nSides\nYukon Gold Potato Puree  - I didnt expect it to be so good. \nRoasted Shiitake Mushrooms - i usually dont eat these, but i gobbled them down. \nRoasted Asparagus\n\nDesserts\nMonkey Bread w/ice cream - very sweet\nCrumble Berry \nCheesecake w/ice cream\n\nYou get fresh warm bread with your meal. They have a wine special for $30. They give you 3 different wines, 1 for each entree. \n\nLike women walking out of a spa.....I felt pampered and fullfilled. The food made love to my mouth and spooned with my stomach. \n\nI'll be back!"
3,"Solid 4 stars!\n\nIs nice to get away from the strip if you're there for an entire week!!! The ambiance here is great! Very calm and the service is great. \n\nThey are so high tech! The waiter took our orders with his iphone and it was submitted into the kitchen! He said the owner created an app. Genius!  \n\nYou can never go wrong with Tikka Masala!! We came here for dinner with a party of five. No buffet--a la carte. \n\nWe ordered an assortment of dishes, but my favorite was the tikka masala with garlic naan. \n\nI also ordered the peach lassi, which was pretty good. It tasted like a peach yoplait! hahaha\n\nOh, I forgot to mention, but they have a GREAT, extensive selection of alcoholic beverages!!!"
4,"I'm solely basing this review on the foundation of this establishment, \""the cheese pizza\"".  This cheese pizza by far has to be the best tasting cheese pizza I've come across. The combination of their sauce, the spices and ingredaments in the cheese gives this pizza a MOUTHFULL of flavor with every bite. I wouldn't mind putting extra toppings to give it some more pizazz, but I think it would take away from its' flavorful awesomeness. I'm actually waiting to go pick a cheese pizza up with 50 wings. Cripes I'm hungra... \n\n5 STARS ON THE CHEESE PIZZA YO!!! GREAT SUCCESS!!!\n\nUpdate: I just finished my portion of the pizza. This place is ALWAYS ON POINT!!!\n\nEYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!"
0,I ate here a hour ago. Feeling pretty sick hope its not food poisoning. Tried alot of the seafood. Not to impressed. The food didnt seem as warm as it should have. My fault for eating it I guess....would not recommend !!!!!
2,Have been there a couple of times. Food is good. Service is always slow. Last time we were there my husbands salad had an ant crawling around. I was very disappointed that no one came over to apologize nor did they offer to discount or comp it. Not cool.
4,"How could I forget to write a review about this place!?\n\nMe and my teammate stopped in for \""tapas style brunch\"" after a tournament.  For a few extra bucks, brunch came with bottomless mimosas.  Now, I ate here earlier this summer, so I don't remember EXACTLY what we had, but all I can remember was how awesome everything tasted and next time I'm at Mandalay Bay on a weekend, we WILL return for brunch.\n\nFood: 5 stars man, it really was delicious.  Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.\n\nThere were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.\n\nService: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.  We left her a bomb ass tip.\n\nAtmosphere: We ate on the outdoor patio, overlooking the hotel pool.  The sun was shining in, the air was fresh.  Loved it.  \n\nMaybe it was Vegas, maybe it was the drinks, but either way I was quite wooed by the whole experience."
1,"I recently relocated from Houston where there is two Del friscos, one is the Eagle and the other grille I believe. I am a rewards member and know how and what to expect from the staff at a Del Friscos and my experience here was horrible. \n\nThe hostess was a gem and seated us anywhere we wanted that was available,  but the waiter Brent was a incompetent jackass. I immediately knew what appetizers I wanted and he asked if I wanted to see the prices on the menu first, lmao. I was thinking this was a joke. I had to call him over several times because he seemed to be distracted by the business men at the table over. He must've thought he would get more bang for his buck if he attended to them and not me and my date. \n\nThe food is and always will be great and Del friscos as a whole is amazing, but when I tried to escalate this to management and he advised I would receive a gift card in the mail. (Only to realize upon me checking the status of that he was let go from the company) . This has left a horrible taste in my mouth about the Phoenix. If in Houston please visit the one off of kirby, they will treat you like family."
1,"Thank you for the friendly service! But the food was too sweet for me and never really did it for me. I'm willing to try it again, based on it's close location, but I will hope for a spicier experience."
1,"I don't do dollar stores often, but I thought I'd head in to this one a couple of weeks back as I was in need of some Halloween candy and anything else that struck my fancy.  \n\nI wasn't impressed.\n\nThe store had a poor selection, but I managed to find about $30 worth of things to purchase.  It didn't seem very clean or organized either.  At check-out, the woman was not friendly at all and when I went to leave with my cart, I was stopped at the door by the big pole attached to the car.  (I guess the carts are only to be used inside the store and this stops them from leaving).\n\nI do not plan on returning to this store.\n\nIf you are interested in visiting a store for cheap / affordable items of all kinds, I think the 99 cent store may be a better option.  They carry produce and more food products also.  I'll be taking my dollars elsewhere moving forward.  Sorry dollar tree."
1,"Ick.\n\nIt was one of those evenings when you toss dinner options back and forth, but nothing really sticks.  \n\nIn retrospect, we should have stayed home.  Even in the barren, food-less space that is my kitchen, I could have done better.  However, lured by an ad boasting a \""World Famous Gyro\"" for the bargain price of $5, off we went.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly greeted by a man I assume is the owner, shown to a table, and given menus.  A few minutes later, he came back to tell us he would send someone over to take our order.  Great.  Strangely, the waitress that arrived to ask us what we would like to drink couldn't/wouldn't take our food order, as someone else was actually our waiter.  Huh?  Well, we finally were able to order from our real waiter (who was very nice, by the way and the ONLY reason for 2 stars vs 1) and our World Famous Gyros arrived shortly.  \n\nUh, no.  What I found on my plate was a pile of sauce wrapped in paper.  The entire gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  Now I happen to really like tzatziki, but but not to the point that I cannot even identify what I am supposed to be eating.  I scraped off as much as I could, but then only tasted overly salty meat, soggy lettuce and yes, sauce.  After a few bites, I waved the white flag of surrender - I just couldn't do it.\n\nGuess you get what you pay for...."
0,"Came here last night & had the worst experience ever! I ordered the bbq wings & fat fries. When my food came out, my wings looked burnt. I ate one and they were horrible. I sent them back & continued to eat my fries. When finished, I noticed my left upper lip had swollen. I asked for a manager and he didn't seem concerned at all but I did feel out a report. I will never go back to this place. I'm not allergic to any foods so I knew it had to be this place. So enter at your own risk!"
2,"The food was excellent here.\nThe reason why I am giving this place 3 stars was the service. It was really over the top.\n\nWe were not treated very well by one of the staff members. He seemed really annoyed with us. I am a music person from Nashville and was in for the Country Music Awards show and the Film Production conference with a bunch of folks from Hollywood. We are well used to $125 plate meals. This is a $36-$40 a plate restaurant and it did not carry Emeril's inviting, warm personality to it at all.  You never know who you are seating so you should always make your guests feel warm and welcomed. This place felt hostile.  The service was so over the top. The staff was dictating our meal service by taking our plates away before we were done and did not listen when we asked them not to take plates away. Our utensils were in the correct positioning to convey this message. The staff really work hard here, but it was like they felt they were under a microscope. We won't be going back there because of the staff.\n\nThe guy that took our orders and checked on our table seemed annoyed with us for ordering water as we were dehydrated from traveling. There were staff complaining about tips from other tables openly. \n\nImprove the personality of your staff and restaurant and perhaps we will go back some day."
2,"If you love M&Ms, this place is your Mecca.  If you don't, it will bore you to tears.\n\nI happen to fall in the latter category (yeah, I know, I know -- but M&Ms really *don't* do it for me).  The first time I was in Vegas, I just came in to see the panoply of M&M colors you won't find elsewhere.  And on that count, I wasn't disappointed.  You won't be, either: the candy wall is definitely a sight to see and the reason I give them three stars.\n\nThis visit we went in because it was so darn hot out and M&Ms' doors were open, blasting cool, conditioned air at us when we oozed by.  So I figured I'd pop over to see what was new in the M&Ms rainbow.  The so-called \""Vampire\"" mix with gray, black, white, and red candies made me giggle.  \n\nSome of the merchandise is cute, I suppose, if you lust after the melt-in-your-mouth-not-in-your-hand candies.  Whatever you can think of, they've put the M&Ms logo on it.  But who buys the sequined M&Ms purses???"
3,"Cheesy Tater Tots...need I say more? The Vig offers a handful of different delish food items to choose from. They are expanding and just opened up a new location in McCormick Ranch that offers a late night menu. However, at their Uptown location my favorite drink on their signature cocktail menu is Take Bethany Home. It's refreshing and not overpowering, the perfect combination of ingredients. I highly recommend visiting The Vig closest to you!"
4,Gas is $.30 cheaper here than in San Diego! Got to love not paying over $4/gallon.
3,"I can't go bowling anywhere else...before midnight. \n\nSunday through Thursday, after midnight, each game is only $1.00! My hubby and I bowl regularly and once we discovered that bowling here was a buck after midnight, we made it a ritual to go at least once a week. Other than the fact that the lady who rings us up is kinda weird and doesn't listen to you, and you get stuck by either really annoying people or those \""young un's\"" on dates that have nowhere to go, so they go bowling and suck face after every frame,  the place is okay.\n\nI love that there's no smoking in the bowling area. That doesn't stop people from trying, but generally, it's nice to bowl without running the risk of developing emphysema. \n\nBowl after 1am and there are a few regulars, people on dates, some even bringing their kids and bowl while they entertain their dates at the bar (yes, this happens and it shocks me every time), and then the bar closes. \n\nBowl after 2am and you basically have the place to yourself...and the weird lady behind the counter who put the TV on behind her on and watched Criminal Minds or Law and Order SVU if it's on. \n\nBowl after 3am and you really are by yourself and the weird lady with no personality. Maybe a security guard or custodian. And by then, you are now bowling a 45 and need to go home. \n\nI love this place. But I REFUSE to give it a 5 because of the weird lady with no personality to never listens. We ask every single time, \""Can we have a lane far from everyone?\"" She says, \""Okay,\"" but never does it. \n\n**Plus its 8 minutes away from my house. 6 if I hit all the greens! :D"
2,"Went with a large group of 8 for a business dinner.  The service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed to disappear at times and prolonged the dinner.  It was fine because we had a lot to discuss, but out out-of-town guest were probably tired from a long day of training so it would have been nice to make dinner a bit shorter.\n\nI ordered the penne rustica and it came to the table in a piping hot bowl.  It was nice the put a plate under it and I definitely devoured the whole thing."
3,"It's been a while since I took part in the nightlife in Scottsdale, it's not my scene but I was invited to White House for a party so you know how that goes.\n\nI arrived at 10:30 on a Saturday night.  The crowd was sparse but I didn't care because that meant that I would get my drinks quickly.  The d\u00e9cor was minimal, everything was white and it seemed very well lit for a nightclub... less chances of ending your night with coyote ugly at this establishment.   There wasn't a cover charge and the drinks were... well I can't say if they were pricey because they were being paid for, but I can attest to their deliciousness.   I never had to wait in line for the bathrooms which were seemingly clean and also provided a bathroom attendant to hand you a towel... no toiletries though.  The staff was great, really cute bartenders that like to flirt.  The DJ was also a charmer and introduced himself to me.  He was playing a so/so music which basically consisted of top 40.  I can't really blame him though, I think it's a pretty common recipe to try to get people on the floor, which, by the way, was lifeless at this point but that didn't stop me, I grabbed a friend and danced the night away.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to any other Scottsdale skeptics."
3,"Just an update for dairy-free folks. There was a miscommunication. When I asked if it was diary free, they said yes... referring to the batter. Unfortunately, they still dip everything in milk to make the batter stick. I don't know why they didn't think to mention this. Still great people, but you would think after countless times of me saying \""I'm dairy free, so no coleslaw\"" that they would think to mention that everything is dipped in milk! Still really nice people, though."
0,WARNING DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!! Whatever you do stay away this place is back under the old management and it's terrible. Been shut down by the health department so many times!! Most of the stuff they serve is from restaurant depot and is not very good quality. Please save your time and money for all sushi restaurants sake. So sad the other owners didn't work out the food quality went way up now it's just crap like before.
2,"It's a Vegas buffet what else can I say. It was $88.00 for two of us on Sunday night. I'm not a huge buffet fan but it was my partners first time in Vegas so we had to go to one. Would I go back? Well yes if they wanna comp me but no if I have to pay. Again, not saying it's bad just saying typical Vegas buffet. Everyone should try it once. I just feel for $88.00 I can get a better meal that's not a buffet."
3,"We did not have to pay for tickets and the guy that bought them got a Black Friday deal so we had some decent seats. How can you complain about a free show?\n\n   The visuals and aerials were incredible. They left me thinking about the performance a week later. The music is from the slower songs by the Beatles. Even though I was familiar with them, my girlfriend was not.  \n\n   There is so much happening at once that it was easy to become overwhelmed to the point I lost track of the story they were trying to tell; however the stage was specifically built for this act so I concentrated on that and was amazed by just the technical aspects.  There is a behind the scenes tour that I would love to check out."
2,"Known at my work as \""the man on the corner\"" the holyrood cafe is the main supplier of breakfast rolls for the work force. It's all pretty standard fare, and fairly standard price. The falafel wrap was surprisingly tasty though. I think I'd give this place 4 stars if they got a decent fridge for their soft drinks. Open fridges suck, frankly. They don't really cool down the drinks, and actually heat up the room their in. \n\nYou can sit in but there's nothing particular to write about in that regard. All in all pretty good but not quite great."
1,"I dont mind coming here during the day, but I try to avoid coming here later in the evening. I just always have a bad feeling about this place and the kind of crowd that come around in the evenings. Price-wise, its just like every other walmart."
3,Another great Fox Concepts Restaurant...no surprise here!  The space is absolutely great - amazingly bright and open.  The service is extremely quick at lunch which is much appreciated.  And...the food was great!  My pasta was flavorful and just the right portion.  I am confident this place will be a huge success and imagine it is pretty hard to get a table at peak times.
0,"My parents had a 20 dollar off a 50 dollar purchase coupon and off we went.  Having just returned from Greece, maybe I'm being a food snob but this was not traditional Greek food.  My Mom seems to think they are under new ownership because she said the food was very different from the time before.\nWe enter an empty restaurant with fake and dried flower arrangements (a big pet peeve of mine).  We order Greek Salad and it is teeming with dressing and very little feta.  Our Kabobs reminded me of the Indian food I had the week before and accompanied with \""steamed\"" vegetables that look like the kind you buy from the frozen section of your local supermarket.  Pita is not fresh.  Portion size is good though due to the loads of basmati rice on the plate.  Decent amount of chicken for the money.  Service was attentive.  \nAn old Sting concert is blasting from the random flat screens located around the restaurant.  Unfortunately, while we were there we got caught in an unusual heavy rainstorm.  We were there long enough for the Sting concert to be over only for them to restart it and play it again.  I was trapped in my own personal hell!  Andes candies at the end wrapped up this \""Greek\"" experience."
1,"Doesn't compare with the other Max's restaurants I have been to. Mid-week and the food tasted refrigerated and been in the freezer for weeks. Filipino food is meant to be very tasty and rich, not americanized and bland. Even my non-Filipino guests who have no idea how accurate the dishes should taste , were not impressed. Hope they listen to the feedbacks here , as I have been eating these dishes all my life and I know how good they should taste. Ambiance, location , parking and decor is great, but we came for great tasting food."
0,This place is straight garbage.  If you enjoy waiting in line to be thoroughly disappointed then go here.\n\nUnless you had the foresight and budget to drop the cash on a booth (not really worth it for the wife and I alone) your basic admission allows you to stand in a series of hallways with security guards constantly reminding you to keep walking.  This place is FILLED with red tape and security guards.  Not my idea of a good time no matter what celebrity they keep announcing is attendance over the sound system.  The dance floor is pretty lame too and is packed to the gills WAY beyond what is comfortable.\n\nCheck out some of the lesser hyped but more reasonable and fun clubs in Vegas- Studio 54 and Rok are good choices.
0,"I am embarrassed to say how much I paid this company for nothing - thousands and thousands of dollars. Reports were terribly late, my reps cared nothing about me or my company and the customer service was abysmal. Additionally, they charged my company for 2 months of service after I cancelled, then acted like I was crazy when I very kindly & calmly asked them to remove the charges worth over $5000 - they acted like I was crazy. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone or any business. Shady and concerned only about THEIR bottom line, not the growth of YOUR business."
4,The burger was excellent. Ordered to go at the counter and it took under 10 minutes to get my food. Ill be back.
2,Not a bad place I just had to many bobas  for my liking. Otherwise the taste was a welcome change.
3,You have to be careful here and only order the Hawaiian food because they also offer Chinese food but they jacked up the price for that and you don't get as much as when you order Chinese food. I get the Loco Moco because it's huge and cheap
2,"I thought I should write a review for this place because I got an extra chicken finger in my meal... (vegas luck?) and I also won money gambling that day...and it started off with that extra chicken finger!\n\nI ordered #2 which comes with 3 chicken fingers (but i got 4 and I saw it as a sign that I had good luck to gamble haha), fries, and their very buttery toast bread!\n\nFast food is usually not my thing with all that extra grease and oil, but Canes was pretty good with their special canes sauce that I dipped everything in. I think the chicken is just ok and their unsweetened icetea is pretty good. I mixed the unsweetened with 1/8 sweetened ice tea (otherwise it's just too sweet).  My favorite was definitely the bread though (I would exchange that over fries) :)"
0,"This place is a joke. \nCame in with my sister and we told them exactly what we needed, she wanted a pedicure and I wanted a full set and polish change on my toes. \nThe guy told us as soon as she was done with the polish change, he would start my full set because we had to be out by a certain time. \nOnce my polish change is done, a new lady comes in and wants a manicure, so the guy takes her and leaves me waiting! Mind you, my sister has been soaking her feet now for the past 20 minutes. We ask them what their plan is for our nails and they tell us to just come back later. At this point we made it clear unless they did what they said they would do, we wouldn't be coming back. \nThe lady was laughing and apologizing, and then wants $10 for my polish change. Fine. So I pull up the 10% off coupon and she asks, \""you really want 10% off of 10$? That's only a dollar\"" of course I want to use it since I won't be back! \nI had $8 cash for a tip, and she rang me up at $9. So I gave her my credit card. \""Oh, you don't have cash? I can't run this, has to be a certain amount haha\"" \nThen the guy says it's company policy to have a charge be at least $15, but he'll run it for me today. Bullsh*t. I should've just left without paying. Avoid this place and their awful service!"
3,"Best creamery in town! They currently hand out buy one get one free coupons (limited to waffle cones or waffle bowls) if you get a medium or large icecream. Not sure how long the deal will last, but it's definitely a steal, and it's great for friends/lovers to enjoy. Some of my favorite flavors include dark chocolate, butter pecan, and nutter fluff. So good!!"
0,"Sadly I would of never thought I would be giving Olive Garden a 1 star. \n\nFound out that my favorite event at OG was going on and since we hadn't yet been into our neighborhood OG since it was new, it was a easy choice. We arrived and and were seated immediately by the front entrance.\n\n Nikki was our waitress and we placed our orders. I ordered the Asaigo garlic alfredo on angle hair pasta and the chicken noki soup. After the normal wait time our salads and soups were brought to the table. I kind of laughed as there was only about 1/4 inch of soup in my bowl. All broth and 1 piece of gnocchi. I started to eat it and about 5 minutes later Nikki stopped by to check on us. I asked for another bowl of soup, and she stated,\"" I don't know why your filling up on soup when you ordered the endless pasta.\"" Well, I was embarrassed and just told her I like the soup. She leaves and brings back another bowl of soup and it is once again only has about 1/4 of a inch of soup in it with no gnocchi  at all. Just the broth! I asked Nikki why this was and she said she had to scrap the bottom of the pan to get that much and that they were waiting on someone to bring them more.  Now I know this is just me, but the manager stops over with a big smile wanting to know how we are doing. I told him that I was put off by Miss Nikki and what she said to me. How awkward I felt. He said he would get to the bottom of it. Now out comes Nikki bringing me a full bowl of soup and asks me in a condescending voice, \""is that enough gnocchi ?\"" WTF!!! I didn't even ask for that bowl! Now while she is there someone else brings out our food. So I have my pasta in front of me and I don't even touch the soup. \n\nI am disappointed in my service. I really did not enjoy my dining experience because of this particular person. I would much rather drive the extra 5-6 miles down to Cheyenne Rd and go to that OG. Because for the 7 years I have been going there I have had excellent service.\n\nI won't be back anytime soon, as we are fans of Michoacan and they KNOW how to provide a good meal with great service,and it's basically in the same parking lot we will go there if we want to stay close to home."
3,"I went on a weekday during Arizona Restaurant week.  The food was fantastic - classic food done really well (rack of lamb) or new twist on a familiar dish (sweet potato gnocchi with chorizo).  Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  The wine flight was excellent.  The only subpar dish was the dessert  - prepared in individual servings resulted in the bread pudding becoming rather dry, however the flavors were quite nice.\nI can't wait to try their brunch."
1,"Good service. Average food. Bad air conditioning to the point where it was steaming. Banana Nutella crepe had barely any Nutella, mostly just bananas and cream. The place has potential but they need to pick it up a notch."
0,Bouncers are assholes working with the cops to generate revenue.  Be careful if you go here.
1,"Two of us came here for New Year Eve dinner.  We were sat in the lounge area for dinner.  Granted we were walk-in and the main dining area was full.  The food was good, but nothing too special.  It was expensive for what it was.  Given so many options in Vegas, I probably will not go back."
4,"Very nice staff! It would be not only for the best chocolate to enjoy the shopping experience there.\n\nGodiva chocolate in my opinion is the best chocolate, but also one of the most expensive."
1,"Overrated.\n\nIt's a good burger. Service and quality are great, but $30 for a [mediocre] burger, fries and a beer is ridiculous. Having a celebrity chef's name on this place doesn't mean that it's a great burger.  Add to the fact that he's known for his french and haute cuisine - means he shouldn't know that much about burgers.\n\nNot bad, but not worth the price.  Even for Vegas.\n\nI'll be running to the In-N-Out about a mile away instead."
1,What is the mgm anymore without its lions now they have put translucent cover over the entire lion habitat.  How retarded! !
3,"This place has pretty good thai food. Been here a few times.\nWe ordered pad thai, mongolian beef, and pad see eww. The place is nicely decorated, and the waitress/waiter are friendly. First time, our pineapple fried rice took forever to come out. I think they forgot our orders.  But the last two times, the food came out in good time."
4,"I have been to this establishment numerous times. I have tried their pizza compared to others and I keep going back. The crust is amazing, chewy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. Just how I adore it. Their pizza with only mushrooms is my go to favorite. I also like the buffalo chicken.  I have not had a bad pie here. Joey and Victor are always in a good mood, kidding around, having fun. They like what they do. The atmosphere is always uplifting.  So I will continue to drive the 15 miles from my house to the Pizza Company to get my fix."
1,"Prices on the main menu are outdated. Ordered an appetizer sampler (11.99 on menu) supreme nachos ($6.49) and 2 drinks. My receipt did not have the prices on it. I thought I heard $23 over the phone which sounded fair but it turned out to be $33. They should update their prices, but if they did, I probably would not have ordered in the first place.The nachos were good but the items in the sampler were unseasoned and bland."
2,"Hob Nobs is completely unrecognizable from the old Willo House... and you know what?  That's ok.  Let's be honest.  The Willo House coffee really wasn't very good, and the service was pretty lacking.  So I'm over it.\n\nOn to Hob Nob... it's a really lovely remodel, if a little slick and glossy.  I thought the coffee was very good.  I haven't been able to eat there yet, but the menu looks great, if a little pricey.  Pastry selection seemed a little small too, especially as coffee shop= guilt free decadent eating in my mind, so I want some outrageous and fatty desserts to choose from.\n\nLocal artwork on the walls, with some pieces that I really loved.  The tables each have a different SUPER cool picture of Phoenix.  Very nice service, and I believe they said they'd be offering 2 hours of free wi-fi if you are a paying customer.  \n\nI've been twice now, and I liked it ok... I just didn't LOVE it.  It took me forever to write this review, as I don't have anything bad to say about it at ALL, but for whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to rave about it.   It's not especially homey, somehow, even as nice as it looks.  I'll have no problem going back next time someone says \""hey let's go to Hob Nob's\"", but it's just not my first pick.  \n\nHere's hoping that they DO find the perfect crowd that does love them though, and I really hope they succeed."
4,I ate here before the Thursday night Art Walk on main street. The food was great and the ambiance was nice. MIchael at the bar introduced himself and was great in helping me.   I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to anyone.
3,"I went here on a sunny spring day with my wife for lunch.  It has a cool modern atmosphere with direct views of the capitol from almost any seat.  The burger I had was good, but very messy.  I think the bun could have been slightly bigger.  I like the huge ceilings inside.  Overall a good option on the square that I will try again.  I think happy hour here could be a good idea especially with summer on the way and their big tap beer selection."
1,"came to rhythm kitchen on a recommendation from a friend.  the warning sign went up pretty quick when the server recited the evening's special.  barramundi with coconut risotto and mango salsa.  is that Cajun?  thankfully I passed but one of my dining companions made the mistake of ordering it.  I tasted the fish and although it hadn't gone bad.....yet, it was well on its way.  I started with crab cakes.  not bad.  for dinner I had the jambalaya.  again not bad but I could have made it in my own kitchen and it would have been at least as good, if not substantially better.  we shared beignets and bread pudding for dessert.  never really had a beignet but I wasn't impressed.  give me a good sopapilla anytime.  the bread pudding was like the rest of the meal."
2,"Recently opened and already having won several local awards, Pink Olive claims to offer \""exceptional food, no exceptions\""; this is definitely the case.\n\nMy partner opted for the 'Bigger, Meatier Breakfast' (\u00a37.95), which was essentially a double-sized portion of the perfect scottish fry-up,  complete with haggis. There wasn't a single thing on the plate that wasn't cooked perfectly, although i don't think i would have been able to eat a whole plate!\n\nI went for the slightly healthier sunday morning option, of the soup of the day (\u00a33.95) and a grilled mackerel fillet on a bed of lemon-dressed salad (\u00a34.95). The soup was seasonal vegetable and pearl barley, and was much tastier and more flavoursome than any vegetable soup i've had before. It's true that the mackerel was slightly greasy, however this was off-set by the crisp lemon juice drizzled over the salad. \n\nI'd definitely recommend trying the homemade iced teas. We couldn't choose between lemon or peppermint, so got one of each and both were delicious. My partner said they were the best he's ever tasted outside Morocco.\n\nIn fact, my only criticism would be the issue of space... or lack of it. Too many tables crammed into too small a restaurant took something away from the relaxed, sunday morning atmosphere."
2,no offense but the waiter or the server should really need to learn that the rice and the curry should be placed into two different boxes to go!
4,Love this place.  The steak and flank with an over easy egg is the bomb!!  Plus they make great pot stickers!!
2,"While I get that it's a great bookstore, I don't understand why everyone thinks it's the best. More than once, they've not had newer books I was looking for (that should have been easy enough to find) and the staff seem elitist and stuffy, as if I'm not \""Green\"" enough to shop there, and were never around when I actually needed help.\nThis is a great place if you're into, for lack of a better word, Hippy things. But not the non-materialistic Hippy, more like the \""I have so much money that I don't need to buy mass produced things\"" Hippy.\nThe best part about this store is that they have a ton of events and seem to be really involved in the community. They also have a ton of unique and/or handmade gift items - a huge portion of the store is dedicated to this - but make sure to have a lot of disposable cash because it's all expensive.\nBesides events or out of sheer boredom, I wouldn't go out of my way to shop here."
2,"I don't do clubs, but I liked Ghost Bar.  The people were friendly (meaning the boys were very friendly) and the view is really nice."
1,"Uh. I was SO looking forward to you, PH, after seeing you in so many movies...but alas, you disappointed! My sister and I go to Vegas once every couple of years. She lives in Baltimore, I live in Boston, so I meet her down in her neck of the woods and after Thanksgiving we get on a plane to Vegas, baby! We've stayed in many hotels here over the years. I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. \n\nFirst of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas. LOTS of dark wood panelling, and the main hotel is definitely beginning to look outdated despite renovations and the tower addition. Maybe my room would be different? Meh. Was it awful? No. Was it anything to write home about? No. It was clean (except the table..there was some type of residue...glass tables in a Vegas hotel room are just ASKING for trouble, if you know what I mean...I can't imagine the things housekeeping has to scrape off after a looonnggg night/morning of partying). My sister's friend met us and she was obviously is a room that had NOT been renovated. Ay yai yai....I would def have asked to move if I were here. Striped walls and a mattress that was lopsided. Looked 20 years too late.\n\nI'm not sure what it is, but even some of the hotels older than PH have a \""newer\"" feel to them. Something feels kind of grimy about PH...maybe it has to do with all the dark wood panelling, but I can't say I was impressed with anything :(\n\nI WILL say the location is EXCELLENT and very centralized to the strip- location wise you can't get much better. While I wouldn't *not* stay here if it was heavily discounted/ or someone else was paying for it, I would not stay here again. Just my opinion! Nothing wonderful, but nothing bad. It's Vegas, so you want it to be exciting, which a lot of the other hotels do a good job with."
1,"Let me start this off by saying that I love q'doba, the food is delicious. Reason for 2 stars you ask? Well I'm currently standing in line, I'm the only one here. I was greeted with \""I'll be right with you\"" and then I waited while the two ladies here finished their conversation! So while the food is great, this experience was not!"
1,"This is based off just one visit when I ordered the BBQ chicken. I haven't had that much eastern NC BBQ but this chicken tasted over cooked and it was overly soggy, like boiled chicken. \n\nThe atmosphere is very inviting, plaid/checkered table covers, paper plates & plastic utensils, friendly staff.\n\nI hope to return soon and update my review ( :"
2,"This was our second time to Au Pied de Cochon, after having an excellent meal the first time. Unfortunately, this time around we were slightly less impressed...the meatloaf, which was one of the specials of the day, was very salty and the staff forgot that it was my boyfriend's birthday, even though I had made a special request when making the reservation and reminded our waiter during the meal.\n\nHaving said that, the food is generally quite tasty and the ambience is lively.  The staff is friendly and professional, but disappointing that they would forget a special occasion, since you would expect more from such a quality establishment."
1,"I can give the food the second chance. However, I still find it unpleasant to be served by half-naked girls in the middle of the day. I am not a conservative and very attractive female who fells free wearing mini dresses and shorts. But, I absolutely find it inappropriate to get food from someone who barely covered. Where is the hygiene? Additionally, there are many other ways to present sexuality (if this is the policy of the place), mature ways that will attract different customers. Place lacks friendly smiling  personal, good selection of beer (Miller, Budweiser and etc topped by one or two local breweries choices). If you want attract customers who value good food, drinks, and service, you need to change some things around. Until then, I will think about ElHefe as a place where people come to get drunk by drinking shitty beer or poor quality drinks at high prices and look at booties! I may be rough with the way I wrote. I very seldom give negative reviews. In this case, I was highly disappointed by the place"
3,"$20/person? The money goes to charity and in return you get to gorge yourself on cupcakes? Mmmmm....let me think....yes!\n\nWent to the Cupcake Love-In for the first time this year and enjoyed every sugary bite.\n\nTwo rooms full of different cupcake vendors, eager to serve you a sample of their sweet treats. I have no idea how many cupcakes I actually ate. I lost count after room 1. \n\nThe best cupcakes were the unusual ones. Sure there were great vanilla and chocolate but if you can put prosciutto and fig into a cupcake and make it work, you're the winner in my book (looking at you Bourbon Steak).\n\nThe only bummer was that a lot of places ran out really early! Event started at 11:00 and by 11:30 places were already out of some things. So we missed getting to try a few that sounded interesting. One place had one with avocado but they were out by the time I got there. :( The event was scheduled to go until 2. I feel bad for anyone that came after noon, really.\n\nBut a good venue, great cupcakes and a good cause. Not a bad way to spend a Sunday."
4,"Great food , live music. Lots of fun"
1,"Ok so this is a tough review for me to write, so let me start with the good. They have a special place in my heart for the work that they do. Now for the bad, I went in to donate some left over food and litter from my cat who I had to put down. This was an extremely emotional thing for me, I don't say that for sympathy but merely to add to the story and my experience. I walked in, clearly a bit distraught, I explained and received a perfunctory 'I'm sorry' followed by \""leave the stuff over there, and do you need a tax form?\"" No thank you, no, can we have your name, no, are you interested in donating money, no, would you be interested in volunteering. Those are all the freebees they get as I consult with businesses including 501C3s. I would be happy to consult with them and greatly reduce my fee because this is so near and dear to my heart. So if you are the executive director or a board member and you happen to read this, please contact me, you could be raising so much more money, and more importantly saving so many more lives."
3,"The modern atmosphere is good for a date night or just hanging out with friends. This place has traditional sushi as well as very unique choices (as the name would suggest). My favorite is definitely the Fusion Maki though it is a little pricey. I definitely think it's worth the price because it's a meal in itself. Also, they have a great $1 sushi deal on Sundays and Mondays. The menu is a little pricey though if you're not going on their $1 sushi nights."
4,I have had several meals there and was very pleased with their comfort foods  .  Deserts are huge portions and very good.  I have also used their catering service. No complaints
4,"A valve on my sprinkler system went out, they came out and had it fixed within 30 minutes. Reasonably priced, I recommend and will use them again if the need arises."
0,"I have stayed in the Luxor many years ago and it was actually pretty nice. I knew the place had gotten old and only booked the room because I was in town for a convention at the MGM which is right across the street. I was prepared for the room to be average and not so nice so my low scores are not based on that. I wasnt expecting a 5 star stay, but what happened over the course of the week was disgusting and so wrong! \n\nFirst of all Ammenities: \n- Rooms are old and out dated\n - Furiture was scratched and broken in some places\n -Bedding was comparible to a motel six \n- NO WIFI! \n- No central A/C so the room doesnt get cold.\n\nok now lets move on to the real reason I will NEVER stay here and will warn everyone I know not to. My Macbook Laptop was stolen from my room while I was out all day. I left my room at 7:00am when I returned at 11pm the laptop was gone. I searched everywhere before calling to file a complaint. They sent up a security officer who had me fill out a voluntary statement.\n\n Once that was done I realized I had no way to charge my cell phone, because I was using the outlet on my laptop. I went to the front desk and asked for a manager. I explained to him that my laptop had been stolen from my room and I had just filled out a report, but that I have no way to charge my cell phone and was hoping the hotel could let me borrow one for the remainder of my stay. The manager was so rude!! He told me that I could go to security and see if they have a charger in lost and found, why would they give me someone elses property! I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied \"" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone.\"" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. \n\nI eventually found the security station. They told me they have a charger but I would have to plug it in and wait for it to charge! 6 hour wait and its 2 in the morning. I told her I have to get up at 5am and cannot wait, so she suggested I leave my phone there. WHAT! after my property was just stolen! I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. \n\nOn top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! \n\nThe next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager. While I was waiting for the manager the valet was telling my husband you better move your car or I'll make you move it. My husband replied to him trust me you dont want me to get out of this car..when the manager came to help me he told me that there is self parking around the back....WHY did the valet tell us that....loh yeah because he is trying to STEAL $100 from us!!! The manager did nothing and told us he has to side with his staff. \n\nAt the end of the day nothing was done about any of this. The manager we spoke to at check out was rude and unhelpful I asked them to refund the room and was actually asked why would we do that? was there anything you didnt get that was promised? WOW how about common customer service and all of my belongings with me during check out. \n\nAlso regarding my laptop I have called risk management over 10 times and no one has called me back. I finally got a hold of someone yesterday who told me the only person who used a key besides myself was the maid. They said she told them she didnt take it so the investigation is closed. \n\nThere are so many great places to stay in Vegas the Luxor is not one of them. I made sure the 16,000 people at my convention about what happened to me and I warn anyone reading this to spare themselves the same experience I had."
2,"I ate here alone, with Groupon.  I ordered a bowl $5.95 of creamy butternut squash soup, which was REALLY GOOD.   It was probably the best butternut squash soup I ever had.   I can tell there was lotsa butter in it, and cumin.  But there was not much soup on in the rather flat bowl.  It really made me wonder how much less soup they put in a \""cup\"" for $3.95, cos I think the \""bowl\"" is a cup of soup poured into a bowl.  I cannot believe that my bowl was more than a cup of soup.  \n\nAlso ordered $14.95 Meat Lovers pizza to make my bill at least $20.  All pizzas are the same size, which I measured with a ruler to be 11\"".   I won't come back to Humble Pie because I think it is expensive for the little portion that you get for the money.  I like \""value\"", which is not here at Humble Pie.   1/3 of the pizza is the crust, which has nothing on it, so the pizza is even smaller.   Taste is good tho.  \n\nI feel the best value for pizza is the House Special at Mellow Mushroom in Tempe.  $20.79 for 14\"" and loaded high and dense with ingredients, best of which is the applewood bacon. \n\nMy server, Jon, was very attentive and polite.   When I was amazed they had cloth napkins for greasy pizza, he brought he larger paper napkins, because I went over to the bar and got myself bar paper napkins.  He brought whatever I asked for, lemon wedges and Sweet and Low (I make my own lemonade), more water."
3,"It's getting cooler in Vegas, and therefore, it is HOT POT SEASON!\n\nI dropped by here with two friends and we ended up sharing two hot pots, and three orders of skewers. Everything was really good. Each of the hot pots were loaded with various vegetables and mushrooms. They could have done with a bit more meat though. I felt that each of the hot pots had too less meat for the amount of soup/veggies inside. \n\nNext... What's hot pot without SAUCES!  Normally, I like to eat my hotpot with a sauce consisting of peanut butter, cilantro, green onions, sa cha (barbeque) sauce, and an egg. I was sad that they didn't have any peanut butter (instead, I used some sesame paste they had, it kind of did the job), and i had to pay an extra 50 cents for an egg.  Seeing as there was not much meat to begin with, I opted to not get the egg. :(\n\nWe had an order of each of the skewers (beef, beef tongue, and lamb). I really loved the beef tongue and the lamb skewers, but the regular beef skewer was just so-so.\n\nAll in all, this place is great for a nice warm meal at night, and I would definitely come back to try their other hot pots! =]"
3,"it's all about Sunday brunch mimosas, French toast, and a room full of desserts. This is my fave place to go in Vegas for breakfast type food. It is all tasty and reasonably priced compared to other Vegas buffets. I cannot wait to nurse my hangover at this place once again!"
0,"i wouldn't give this company another dime. Not only did they have the saddest selection of produce i have ever seen, but the customer service was a joke. \n\nI am all about eating organic and gluten free, and i'm always in search of a fun new health food for my family to try. I went into Whole Food so excited because it was like a health food Costco. I was never once greeted, and i literally got dirty looks from a few of the people stocking shelves. \n\nI felt horribly unwelcome and my shopping experience was uncomfortable to say the least. i ended up buying 3 things because i put most everything in my cart back, and i wanted nothing more than to just leave. I don't even like to drive by that store....\n\nI hope the managers of this store read this and consider a complete staff overview, because this is no way for any store to operate."
2,Basic and decent gym with good low price memberships. At night are the busier hours and harder time to get to weights. My only complaints are the hours of service and no wifi to play music! My phone service sucks by the treadmills and back of the building.
0,Geeze... Empty as can be and I still got crappy service. Well... I would prefer crappy over non existent which is what we got. I gave them another minute before I was just going to walk out ... Waitress finally came with 15 seconds to spare. Very very unacceptable. FYI still haven't got our water yet either. Avoid this place unless you want to leave by retirement age.
2,"Went here for lunch today. I've been driving past this place for a few years now, so was looking forward to finally trying it. It was good, nothing to write home about though. We had the lunch specials - I had the chicken enchilada with green sauce and rice and beans, my friend had the chicken tacos. Extremely small portions, wow. For $6 a meal, which ok is affordable, and true it's just \""lunch portions\"", I still was expecting more. The enchilada was the size of a tortilla roll-up, like really really small. The tacos were also three tiny lil guys, like maybe only 3 inches long. The taste was just alright too - I mean it was good, but again nothing that's going to make me go back again. \n\nThe service was good, the server was attentive and our drinks kept getting refilled.\n\nSo yea...good, but nothing spectacular. Maybe dinner is better."
2,"Slow Boat to Greek Isles\nThere is no scent as stimulating to my appetite as that of garlic in the oven or on the range top. This is just what greeted us as we walked in one rainy evening about 5:30 just off the light rail line in Charlotte. The setting is lively and open with tables well-spaced and the staff is attractive and friendly. We got menus soon enough and drinks were ordered. My choice was a local IPA, sorry I have forgotten the name of the brewery. It was cloudy! Tasted all right and I assume that this is what the brewer had in mind but it was weird. Not sure I will ever get use to that. Appetizers followed with Tzatziki and Feta for all and they, especially the Tzatziki were good for sure. Then we waited and hour for our meal to come!!\n\nOur water was certainly a nice chap and perhaps new at his job but clearly needed some help on the management side of his work. Don't know what the holdup but it was obvious and no apologies. To top it off I think I chose wrong off the menu. My salt cod may have been frozen and packaged. I can't be sure but it was very ordinary. I ate it all of course buy my companion's veal shank or dolmades looked much better. Dinner took so long that we did not have a time for dessert which is a shame. The cart up front with samples looked delicious. I'm going to have to give this a 3 because of my meal and the service. I'd like to go back and try again, it's very reasonable and convenient to down town without being down town but, I don't know."
0,"Manager's attitude:\nFirst, with party of 25, mgr only wanted to give us 2 tables to fit 25 people. We requested 3 tables, first we got a big fat \""NO\"". When I turned my back and start walking out, half way walk to out side, mgr changed mind to said \""yes\"".  I could take this business to anywhere else yet family started arriving. By the the of dining, restaurant never reach 80% fill\n\nSanitary issue: \nThis restaurant mixed drinking serve water glasses to guest with dirty dish tray on the same cart! \n\nPissed poor services:\ndim sum cart keep passed with no stop even I ran after it, it won't come by. Until I called mgr to the table to ask why, then we start getting food. Employees were arguing loud with each other, fighting each other, giving orders to others. Bad manners.. Server even took time to argue with me because I want to add order to the my table, which turned into forever food below..\n\nOnly table who did the family style order got their food as their order.\n\nForever food:\nPork belly and preserve vegetable takes 30 minutes? Why even bother put in the menu? Dim sum we want never available, next cart(x4) later.. Still nothing. \n\nOrdering:\nTry to order a simple cold chicken with ginger sauce, 20 minutes. Restaurant \n\n\nBottom line:\n\nI HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND TO EAT HERE ANY TIME OF THE YEAR. SANITARY ISSUE, BAD SERVICES, FOREVER FOOD WILL NEVER SHOW UP FROM MENU,"
2,"Sampled the hazelnut, tiramisu, pistachio gelato and decided NOT to get any. They were creamy buttery lacking flavor. The creme brulee was ok. My friends did like their sorbets. \nChocolate fountain was kind of cool. \nThere are better gelato places than this. I liked Sugar and Ice in Wynn Hotel."
1,Good times.  Great for St. Patty's!!  Get in early to grab yourself a table and start collecting the celebratory plastic cups.
0,"How Disappointing. A \""French Bakery\"" that makes awful croissants. One would think they would make the best ones in town. My advice for the best croissant in the area, go to The Fresh Market. (And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market.)\nAlthough the product comes in frozen (I know, I know) at TFM, when they are baked just right, they are excellent. Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and I'm happy...\nI did try some pastries at Amelie's but nothing to write home about. I tried a baguette and it was edible. I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen. \nNot worth the drive from Cornelius."
4,Dr. Gundermen is the man! He is the only Chiro I have ever been to that I enjoy 100%. You get a nice massage before the adjustment. You get asked questions. Get to ask questions too. Dr. Gundermen explains everything and tells you what's wrong.  Very friendly and affordable. They even give you free visits after going in so many times as well as for your birthday or referring people. These guys rule. As long as they are open and we are in QC I will be going to them.
3,"Burgers have taken on a highfalutin, gourmet attitude, but there are still a few places that make just a regular hamburger, albeit some with hole-in-the-wall status. Open since 1965, The Original Wineburger in Phoenix hits high marks when it comes dive hangouts, but most of all, they make one killer burger.\n\nWalking into Wineburger, you'll feel as if you've been transported to another place and time, and this is a good thing. Surrounded by wood paneling, Formica-topped tables and the glow of neon beer signs, the atmosphere is comfortable and relaxed. Diners seat themselves in either the main bar area or the game area.\n\nA burger joint doesn't bring visions of healthy light snack and salads; let's face it, you're here to eat thick slabs of meat and fried accompaniments. So it's no surprise the menu is full of fried delights, like the tasty Mini Corn Dogs ($4.75), finger-sized corn dogs that were fresh and hot.\n\nI also enjoyed the Cheddar Pints ($5), battered cheese curds deep fried to a golden brown perfection, a Wisconsin favorite.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, the Original Wineburger's fanciest ingredient is a splash of sangria to help enhance the beef's natural flavor and juiciness. The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.\n\nThe Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one. The bacon I added to my burger provided a fair amount of porky smokiness.\n\nWhat's a tasty burger without a tasty beer? Complimenting the salty beefiness, Moose Drool Brown Ale ($3.50) was ice cold and had a sweet malty flavor. Surprisingly light for a brown ale, it was a pleasure drinking. While the Trout Slayer Filtered Wheat Beer ($3.50) was slightly bitter at first, it mellowed into a sweet smoothness that sort of reminded me of an apple.\n\nWhen it comes to burgers, simplicity is king -- it's still just two pieces of bread and a ground meat patty."
0,"EXPENSSIVE FOR NOTHING! You have to realy wanna blow some $$ to be seet that you blow some $$$.\n\nMen $20 Women $10 to get in. To \""rent\"" a seat MINIMUM in food and drinks $100/chair!"
4,Tried Bouillabaisse for the first time at Oyster Bar this trip and it was amazing! It might be my go to dish from now on. \n\nAmazing oysters...so meaty and clean. We ended up making the trek twice! \n\nTip: There's almost no wait when you go around 3pm. Any later and a line starts to form.
0,"My girl friend and I ate here for lunch one day and sat in the bar area, at a booth. They took over 10 minutes to bring our drinks and then this bartender named Jonathon came over to take our orders. Jonathon was SO ANNOYING. He kept cracking jokes and offering appetizers, side salads, desserts... things we just weren't interested in ordering. He recommended a dish for me, I ended up not liking it and when he asked I told him I didn't care much for it, and he just shrugged and walked away. He seemed to ignore us for the rest of the meal. It was awkward and I won't go back simply bc I don't ever want to have Jonathon as my server."
4,Idk if they had seen a dirtier car than the one I just dropped off for a full detail. Curtis and Kevin teamed up and did an outstanding job couldn't b happier! Great customer service thanks again guys
0,"Ill give that hotel 1 star or motel style ,no cufe in room  i asked Y ?they told me even belagio  hotel dont have ,are u comparing to that !!! Slow as speed internet , no buffet. Away from strip its not worth it"
3,"I stopped in for a late night drink right before they closed on a Tuesday night. It was a fair price for the High West Whiskey, but what really made my night was how Tabby and Kat made me feel welcome even though they were closing. They had plenty of time to spend with me and ask about my night. I'm a bar manager at a nice place right down the street, so I can really appreciate their late night service and the time they speny with me. Thanks!!!"
4,"This is a great place for dine-in, delivery, or take-out Chinese food! The restaurant itself is clean, casual, and provides a comfortable environment to hang and eat for however long. The prices are reasonable and portions are generous.\n\nMy favorite is their Szechuan garlic chicken extra spicy with white rice. They provide plenty of meat so that you're not fishing through too many veggies to find it. The chicken fried rice is also good because it isn't too greasy. I'm normally not a big fan of fried rice but I enjoyed the one here. I also recommend their wonton soup... hearty and comes with quality wontons (not the yellow, Americanized kinds), and the broth isn't too salty like most other places.\n\nStaff is friendly and helpful... (we all know this is not the case for most Chinese restaurants). They're also lenient with menu modifications so if you like your dish extra spicy or enjoy baby corn the way I do, they will not have a problem making these adjustments. :) Overall I definitely recommend this place for a meal that's quick, cheap, filling, and enjoyable."
3,"BJ's is a large scale brewhouse and has the usual bar menu.  The one dish that sets it apart and keeps me coming back has got to be, Avocado Spring Rolls!  Delicious, warm, a joy to eat.  I swear to god, the 2nd time I had these was better then the first.  \n\nThe reason for 4 stars instead of 5??  Well, the first time I went with a friend, we tried one of the microbrews.  It was so flavorless and tasted as if it had been tapped a years before completion.  Anyway, I stick to the beers I know and love, same with the food :-)"
0,"Food probably gets 2 1/2 stars. The waffles and chicken was pretty good.  But nothing spectacular. \n\nMostly upset about being seated in the worst table in the restaurant even thought it was about 90% empty when we walked in. When we asked for a booth they said sorry that's for party of 5 or more. This was obviously a lie as they went ahead and seated two groups later with 4 people. And they were all white. Very disappointing.  What's even worse, we all had stomach \""problems\"" afterwards. All in all a horrible experience."
3,"Enjoyed it a lot. Good crowd going on a Thursday night when I pulled in by chance - just walking by. Menu looked interesting. Casual but cozy atmosphere. Scored a decent table despite just walking in off the street with no reservation on a Thurs night and was seated quickly.\n\nStarted with a chicken soup of the day and then the Sznycel Mielony - tasty ground meat with mushroom sauce served along with some fried potatoes and what I can only guess was some cabbage? should have asked, but it was good.\n\nLimited wine menu by the glass but I found a Canadian Mission Hill cab from the Okanagan Valley that went nicely."
0,"I enjoy finding good \""hole-in- the-walls\"" and was out in Apache Junction on a Friday  evening a couple of weeks back and needed to find somewhere to eat. Turned to my faithful Yelp, but was let down this time around.  This is just a just a hole. Worst meal that I'v had in a very, very long time. \nRead a number of favorable reviews and went with the \""specialty of the house\"" -  fried chicken.  Yes, chicken was fried. Can't say much more. On a scale of 1 through 10, I would give them a 1. Chicken smelt a little ripe and they were the smallest chicken pieces I have seen coming out of a restaurant kitchen. \nThis place is a rural bar/saloon at best, and i think that it gets its faithful flowing from the  local folks as there is nothing else close by."
0,"I'm tempted to write a long review about how bad this company is, but I think I've already wasted enough time with them. AVOID\n\nSome highlights of my experience with \""Lydia\"":\n1. Realtor waited until the day I arrived in Vegas to tell me she refuses to show me the property I'm interested in unless I come to the office first to look at other properties. \n2. Realtor gave me the incorrect address for the office\n3. Realtor chastised me for being \""fixated\"" on one property\n4. Tried to talk to someone regarding investing in short term property rentals, no one in this office has heard of AirBNB, lol\n\nUnprofessional garbage. Nothing gets me more irritated than Agents who still think they are blowing your fucking mind by showing you properties on their computer, the same properties you have already seen on your computer days ago, because we live in the information age. Someone needs to put these old goats out to pasture. \n\nI already wasted my time, you shouldn't have to waste yours."
0,"Slow, painfully slow service.  Only one register open regardless of the length of line.  They exist only because they have a perfect location.  Unbelievable the stuff that goes on here yet customers still come on in.  Wait times for food are horrendous.  There will be numerous people with food in hand in line, yet they sometimes have the only register person also making espresso drinks (slowing down the entire line).  I guess that 2nd register at the end is just for show."
1,"Just signed up and already to 3 strikes.\n\n#1-Some creeper stared at me while I swam laps in the pool and clipped his nails for a full 30 minutes.\n\n#2-Signed up for a trainer, showed up ready to go and found out they had \""lost\"" my appointment. No one apologized, acted like it was my fault, and just rescheduled me.\n\n#3-My husband reported that the men's toilet had pee all over it. Seriously, GROSS!\n\nSince I made the financial commitment and really want pool and yoga access- I'm going to try another location out. My husband on the other hand is ready to cancel and go back to Gold's."
0,Hygienist said that it would cost an extra $90 to clean my teeth. I left and went back to my old dentists' office at Family Dentistry (next to Fry's) and they performed the cleaning with no extra charge. The hygienist was extra pushy and refused to do the standard cleaning. \n\nAlso I was having extreme pain in my gum and the dentist could not determine what was wrong; dentist wrote me a referral to go to an oral surgeion. Again I went to Family Dentistry and they found a laceration in my gum and prescribed me the appropriate medication - dentist there said there was no need to go to an oral surgeon.\n\nI had high hopes for this dental office but they fell WAY short of expectations. I DO NOT recommend this place.
2,"It lacks identity. Is it a mediocre Japanese restaurant? Or contempory american? It was well cooked, but it wasn't inspired. For example: my main course was Japanese grilled skirt steak with Shishito peppers. My side was truffle Mac and cheese. Did not pair well at all. . . beautiful place, But just \""Okay\"" food."
0,"We chose Hooters instead of Buffalo Wild Wings because we were with a friend who is from Ireland and had never been to a Hooters. It took 45 minutes for our food to arrive, when we were seated, there was less than 10 parties in the whole restaurant. We asked the server to send the manager over and he blamed the slowness on the kitchen getting slammed because there was an event nearby, but we had arrived before \""the kitchen was slammed\"". He said he would look at our checks and get back to us, he never returned to our table. Our server came back and asked if everything had been taken care of and we said the manager never came back, she finally was able to get our checks. The manager did give us a discount off of our check, but I was overall disappointed in the whole experience and felt bad for our visiting friend who's first impression of Hooters was terrible."
1,"just got back from staying at the Bellagio Hotel for the first time.  All I can say is I was extremely disappointed especially for the price.  First we were put on a smoking floor without notification.  The room was out of date (no flat screen TV) and multiple fixture in the bathroom were falling off.  Turns out they were closing the floor right after we left for updating so they knew the room was not appropriate but still put us there for the weekend.  Finally, service at the front desk was grossly understaffed.  Checking out should not take 30 minutes. Overall would not go back. Better hotels in Vegas."
3,"When someone says \""buffet\"", usually the world of foodies dies a little inside, but I was surprised at how lovely this place was to eat. Me and my fiancee went here as part of a Groupon for a 2-course meal with rice/naan for 2 but after taking our seats the lady who I took to be either the owner of joint owner offered us the chance to try a little more and asked if we would like to take the buffet instead of the 2 courses. I thought I had went to heaven, as bad as the idea of a buffet is, I couldn't say no to unlimited Indian food.\n\nIf the manager is to be believed then everything in the restaurant is homemade, or at least made on the premises. The starters were delicious, the curries were magic, the naan breads were hot and soft and even the desert were lovely but not too sweet.\n\nThere is a part of me that feel reviewing a buffet is like reviewing a Tesco, but I was very surprised at how nice and intimate this place was. Service was great and the food was even better.\n\nAfter having a quick look at the a la carte, I will definitely be coming back to try that.\n\nI'm a self confessed buffet lover and no matter how many good restaurants I go to, I will never change in my need to get elbow deep in food once in a while."
1,"Looks like no one else had my experience.. My mom walked out as miserable as I did, but the friend we took had a great experience. \n\nAs far as massages go, I've had 2: one here, and one at the Hale Koa in Hawaii. My massage at the Hale Koa was in a whole different ball park- like the most amazing experience ever. All the Wynn has are the amazing facilities. You can spend the whole day in there if you like. My actual massage was TERRIBLE. I had a nice enough African American man, and he pinched my skin and left me feeling bruised. This is super unusual for me, as I like my massages rough. It felt like he wasn't massaging muscle, just pinching skin and fat. I'm not a fat person, I was your typical 22 year old, size 7.. so it's not like he couldn't get to my muscles."
3,"Good food, no parking problem. One of the best Indian restaurants in Vegas."
4,"So happy that this place was around the corner from where I was staying this past week. I know that LA has a million coffee shops, but there was something special about GreaterThanCoffee! No pretentious baristas, just super friendly service! Never a line, either! The Toddy was delicious as were the bagels. If I lived in Phoenix, I would definitely come to this place every day. Super curious about Co-hoots, the connecting coworking space."
0,"Discovered this place about a month ago and tonight was my 5th and LAST time ever going. Ordered pizza and wings. Out of an order of wings 4 of them were so small that they should have been thrown away instead of served to customers. I uploaded a picture for you to see for yourself. Look in the photos and you will see a chicken wing next to a sugar packet. The sugar packet is bigger than the chicken wing. In my entire life I have never seen wings this small. Since an order of wings is $10 bucks I said something to our waitress assuming these wings just slipped by and I would receive an apology and a few more wings thrown into the fryer that were bigger than a half inch. Well, I received an apology from the waitress but when she asked the owner if she could rectify the problem with a few more normal sized wings she was told NO!\nNever have I been victim to such awful customer service in my entire life. This place could have had a customer for life with my wife and I, now I can guarantee I will never step foot in the House of Pizza ever again."
2,"Idk, but I feel this place is more hype than legit. Curds were avg as was the burger I had. Not bad but not great. Idk if it is worth the wait."
1,"The double double was ok, the fries was horrid. They was so bland with no taste and was not cooked all the way. The line was so long, our total wait from entering door to receiving order was approx 45 mins. While in line a group walks in with a ferret on a leash. Letting the nasty thing ponder the floor like they was in there own house.  It is very in appropriate to take a animal into a fast food place, and letting it ponder. There was a whole lot of disquisted people in line, more then one employee seen it and said nothing to them about having it in the restaraunt."
0,"I don't know why I spent even a couple hours in this revamped casino hotel because I wasn't impressed from the start.\n\nThe dealers at the blackjack tables are dolled up ladies who circulate between dealing cards and go go dancing.  All fine and dandy if they weren't so rude!\n\nI also expected a lower table limit considering we were downtown and not on the strip.  Yes, it was a Saturday night but $10 minimums at all tables?!?  You can actually find casinos that are similar to this little hole for $3 minimums on the strip (you have to look hard, but they're there!).\n\nMaybe the rooms were nice but I didn't stay there."
1,"We decided to order from here based on Yelp reviews.... Overall I wasn't too impressed.\n\nWe ordered a small Margarita, small deluxe, garlic knots and a small antipasto salad. We hoped it would be worth the $60 we spent, but the pizza was NOT as thin as we hoped. The garlic knots, we're very dough-y and shaped more like blobs. The antipasto salad was mixed greens with rolled luncheon meat---nothing more. \n\nWe'll keep searching..."
1,"Well... I'm surprised they offer a brunch menu. I actually only thought it was a bar. Come to find out they have a dining room next door. Seems kind of like a diner. Which brings me to my next point. It was okay diner food. \n\nThe brunch menu actually looked pretty promising with some delicious looking breakfast sandwiches. Since I wanted something a bit lighter, I went with the omelet loaded with veggies and cheddar cheese. I didn't realize it came with potatoes until I got it in front of me. Plus toast. Which is nice, but I wish I would have been told from my server so I could have ordered wheat... if they had it. The omelet was okay, but the veggies were still kinda hard, like it wasn't cooked very long. And the homefries weren't very crispy, which in my opinion is the best way to do them. \n\nSo here's the weird thing. Everyone ended up getting their food in shifts. We had a party of 8, so it was pretty large, but we were literally the only party in there other than another four top. First shift got their breakfast sandwiches. They'd eaten most of their meal by the time the second shift got their waffles. The third shift was 3 people who'd ordered omelets. \n\nIt just seemed odd that it took so long in between. I wouldn't have noticed much if it was by a few minutes. But it was a good fifteen or more. It wasn't horrible, because there was good company, but it definitely wasn't the best service I'd had. \n\nNot sure about the bar area of Hambone's, but I probably wouldn't come back for brunch."
3,"The first thing to know about Kennedy's, is that this is not just some reincarnation of the old Ed's that used to be the name of this place.  Kennedy's is a whole different bar with a whole different flavor, both inside and out.\n\nNo review about this place is legit unless it mentions the phenomenal patio/deck area in front of the bar as you walk up the front steps.  The patio is full of fans, tables, umbrellas and even mist for when its really hot outside.  \n\nThe inside, bar area can def be a bit cramped, especially during peak drinking nights such as the 4th of July. \n\nBartenders are always friendly and on point.  \n\nI have never eaten here, so I can't say too much about the food.\n\nThere is def a younger, relaxed, New York meets Southern Charm, laid-back vibe to this place.\n\nKennedy's has a Western New York feel which I love.  If you don't know about a trash/garbage plate?  Well, then there's nothing left to do, but step up to the plate come to Kennedy's and learn how we get down in the Rochester, NY!  Roc Boys in the Building Tonight!"
0,Bad service today. Two registers open. One cashier taking multiple orders from one customer. The other cashier let someone cut in front of me then decided she was done waiting on customers. With a line out the door there was no manager around. I left without ordering.
3,"Super kid friendly, for kids under about 7 years old.  The only bad thing is that in the summer time, it gets outrageously hot and there's no where to get A/C protection... but I suppose welcome to Phoenix in the summertime."
4,"This is a really professional, friendly and comfortable place to learn and have fun.  We needed a refresher course before a big wedding, so we responded to an advertised package, liked what and how we were taught, and had no hesitation in signing up for more lessons.  We're almost ready for the wedding and now we're planning additional instruction for the next big event.  We've even joined in a few group lessons.  Our instructor makes the lessons fun, and there is just the right balance between technical and style instruction, understanding our level of competence, and keeping it light and encouraging.  We always look forward to the lessons."
1,"on the 20th, someone mentioned on facebook that there were bad reviews on yelp. since then, there have been nothing but glowing 4 and 5 star reviews. think the owners got their friends to pump them up. I do. c'mon yelp. I was there. not impressed. menu is way too ambitious for a sports bar. some people may like that. I don't. overpriced and off the wall menu. maybe that's why they won't post it on their website. owners need to make up their minds. do they want to be a neighborhood sports bar like they claim, or do they want to be an upscale, overpriced, overrated bistro gastro pub in a neighborhood location. if I want to get ripped off I can go to the strip. i'm looking for a true neighborhood pub. hope they go in that direction."
3,"Sushi for three!  \nI am terrible at ordering sushi. So my darling friend Jen took the lead. \nWe ended up with  2 appetizers - Dragon Balls and deep fried veg, and 40 pieces of sushi - not sure exactly what they were, but there were some California rolls, eel, salmon, cucumber, rice, seaweed wrap and a whole bunch of delicious things! \nPictures to follow! \n\nNice touch: they bring hot towels to your table! Service was attentive and prompt. \nThe restaurant is on a quiet street in Old Montreal, walking distance to a street, I don't remember the name...sawrrrry!\n\nFood was absolutely amazing! We couldn't finish the two plates between three of us. Next day left overs were amazing though!\n\nYum!"
1,"The highlight of my meal was the lemongrass iced tea... which wasn't even that superb to being with. I understand what Tottie is trying to do here, but the execution is just blah. My steamed pork egg roll was dry and more stuffed with lettuce than anything, the peanut sauce didn't even soften it up. The sushi was mediocre and honestly forgettable. The 2nd star is for ambience, since it was pretty strategically lit and set up. I dunno, I wasn't really impressed and probably won't return again, but then again maybe Tottie's isn't my cup of tea."
3,"Recently visited this place for lunch and was pretty satisfied with what The Arrogant Butcher had to offer. I have made it a point to try all of the Phoenix City Scape restaurants and become familiar with the lunch menus of these restaurants.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a graciously hip host who made us feel very welcomed. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool and the location is perfect for downtown lunch commuters. \n\nI had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my friend has the cobb salad. The turkey pastrami sandwich was really amazing and the lunch portions were satisfying enough. I am not a big turkey fan but I will be calling this one of my all time favorite sandwiches, the coleslaw that accompanies that sandwich adds much need texture and is also refreshing. The fresh parmesan fries were great as well.\n\nPlan on visiting this place during your lunch break if you have an hour or more. The place was not busy and it took around 25-30 minutes to receive a sandwich and a salad. This is the only reason why I did not rate a 5/5. \n\nBut overall great resaturant, good food, good prices, good ambience, good drinks, and great experience. Will visit again soon."
4,"Love whole foods! The store has a great selection of fresh, healthy food. I always go in to get a kale salad. This store offers several different ready to go food departments that make it convenient for grabbing lunch, dinner or a snack. I recommend that everyone try whole foods. Don't let the prices scare you, you're paying for quality and its your body that you're fueling. Why not eat good and fresh!"
1,"First: Big ups to Yelp and giving me a 20% off food coupon on my phone after checking in at Hard Rock Caf\u00e9.  We were in a group of 10 so that was big savings.  Showed it to the waiter and he applied the discount no problemo.\n\nFood: Disappointing to say the least.  Pulled pork sandwich was dry and the bbq sauce was too sweet and overpowering.  I also observed my other friends who did not finish their food, not a good sign given that it was lunch and we were hungry. \n\nDrinks: had a large sized mojito which is supposed to have at least 3 shots.  Tasted like there was no booze at all.  My friend who got the same drink absolutely concurred.  Not happy.\n\nService: combined with the 20% off Yelp coupon, the service was the saving grace points of our visit.  Our guy was spot on, full of energy, would sing along with the tracks in the background and give us descriptions of the dishes.  Now if only the descriptions could turn into taste, it would have been a better experience."
0,super small selection.  really.  go to Mandalay Bay instead.
2,"The website has a $2 off coupon, so that makes a men's haircut 13 bucks, but you have to tip, so it comes out to $15 anyway. Nothing great about the haircut really. The girl who cut my hair was nice and we chatted during cut, but she was very young and inexperienced. Nothing got destroyed on my head. It was a middle of the road cut for a walk-in. Might be better if you were a regular and knew someone here that you trusted. Still, it was a very friendly place and a good one-time cut if you need one quickly (i had a 10 minute wait at 11am midweek)"
4,"I actually look forward to my visits!!!! No lie!  Amazing staff, very friendly and caring....almost like being at happy hour with friends without the alcohol.  Lol That's my only suggestion... Serve martinis with a cleaning.   My teeth always feel super clean after my visit.  Honest business people.  Best I have ever been to."
3,"The music is too loud.\n\nSorry, had to get that out of the way. I've been to MTO twice during my lunch breaks from work since it is so nicely close to my place of employment. It is certainly a nice place, with a vibrant color scheme and fun TV screens that display cute sayings and funny pictures. \n\nFood is scrumptious and varies between fatty and healthy. You can find a mix of ingredients, interesting and quirky, while also on the menu, you have traditional items to please the crowds. \n\nLast time I was here I had the FAT ELVIS. I couldn't help myself, french toast with bacon, strawberries, blueberries, bananas, peanut butter, and nutella, served with maple syrup. COME ON, even if you don't want it, you have to be interested, right? It was a heaping portion, for $13 and I only ate half. The mix of flavors is decent, french toast was done right, fluffy, not mushy, nice char on the bread, but not over-powering. Bread used it perfect, big and much like Texas toast style. Fruits were fresh and helpful since the meal is so very filling. Peanut-butter and Nutella flavors go well with the banana, but not so much the bacon in my opinion. I would opt to have the bacon on the side. \n\nI've also had the Hen House wrap here, and I believe it's better than the Fat Elvis. Wrap was not mushy or dry. Lettuce was crispy and fresh. Chicken was grilled well and honestly, probably one of the better wraps I've had in my existence of eating wraps. And I don't regularly consume them. Coffee is also good and comes in a nice, large cup.\n\nBonus - they have PINK lemonade on their menu. Yes, I ordered it. Yes, it was good. \n\nOverall return factor very likely. Recommended for breakfast and lunch."
3,"Deep fried goodness from the snack bar in the back of Mermaids!\n\nI don't go here to gamble or for the drinks. I go for the unhealthy snacks like the deep fried twinkies or oreos, or even the hot dogs. \n\nThe place isn't the newest or the nicest and in fact, this time around, some of the clientele seemed seedy but I wasn't there to make friends - I was there to eat! \n\nI didn't have one but the have hot dogs for a buck. Not too bad if you need something in your gut other than the booze you can get cheap at the bar or anywhere on Fremont Street."
1,"COLORED ONLY: Sat in what felt like the minority section of the patio which was the secluded darkened desolate corner area. This area probably wouldn't have been so bad, but this area also doubled as the smoking section for a family of Russians who decided to come out for a smoke while we were eating...not \""da harasho\"" for us. So if this didn't make you feel like you were in the \""minority section\"", I guess the lack of space heaters would. Every other table had at least one/two space heaters in the vicinity, but we got ZERO on a slightly nipple chill'n' night. When we asked Roger our server for one, he just responded with an off-the-cuff response that there weren't any space heaters (we're out of propane/not working). This would have been slightly tolerable, if we had just popped in unexpectedly, but we had reservations well in advance because this was for a bachelor party (also our tables and chairs didn't match the rest). The only way this was rectified, was luckily for us a food runner named Tommy took the initiative and went into action and GOT US A SPACE HEATER. I'm glad he stepped up, otherwise we would have just gotten left in the cold. \n\nSo why did we not get the attentive service we should have? Maybe our party looked young, and they didn't feel as though they had to go the extra distance, but whatever the reason, Roger didn't come through as he should have although I should say he was very professional in managing his ability to hold on to whatever tip he could hope for. Also his other assistant Mano (don't know the spelling) definitely did do a great job because he did most of the work (not a shock he was minority, haha). Of course, what should be said is that we were most likely just the recipients of bad service/management, but I throw it back to race and blame it on my  Filipino entourage.... Ok, all kidding aside, the moral of this story is that it's not necessarily race/discrimination, but sometimes its just crappy sub-par service whatever color you are."
4,I like yummy wine.  I like yummy beer.  I like yummy food.\n\nPretty hard to find a place that has all 3 out in the west valley of phoenix but here it is!
4,"Wow I love this place! Got the best cut that I've gotten the entire time I've lived in Vegas. ASK FOR NAOMi. She is extremely professional with excellent technique . I know a good bit about cutting hair - for a guy she is too notch and very up to date in the latest styles. Included was shampoo twice, conditioner , paragon hand wax treatment and a facial scrub/massage. $42 plus tip. Setting an appointment through Yelp was a breeze. Don't waste time looking, trust me see Naomi!"
3,"Super yummy Roma pizza- glad I made the trip. Arugula salad a little underdressed, chopped salad was wonderful. Probably could have staffed up for a Saturday night but staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely be back."
2,I can't really give a polished review for this venue when I is be a runnin' late.\n\nI mean its spacious. The staffs nice. I could hear the show. Tall people should stand in the back. Didn't order any food maybe for the next show I will. Haven't really explored much of the venue itself...err...this review needs to be updated the next time I visit. Which will be soon so...yar... don't listen to me.\n\n3 stars.
0,"Great for a car wash but oh my god on the up-sells when you get an oil change. Seriously they are so hard to deal with when they upsell you constantly. Windshield, detailing, fluids, filters..it goes on and on. It just really ruins it and I will just go to walmart where they won't hassle me non stop. Lost customer."
3,"Well, it was a surprise!  Some reviews said that the food quality was very poor and such, quite a contrast actually.  \nThe food was good (chicken tikka, chicken curry, aloo tikki, aloo gobhi, chhole, dal makhani).  The dessert section had kheer (rice pudding) and gulab jamun.  The chicken curry was good and the naan was soft.  The aloo tikki was nothing special and I did not try the vegetarian items as I was full.  \nFor $9.62 including tax this was a good place.  They even had lassis and fountain drinks but I didn't try it.  They do take credit cards too so that helps travelers like me.  I'd have given it a 3.5 stars rather than a 4 but 4 it is!"
0,"Enrique.P\n\nAround mid February we adopted a small dog from spca, we were told that the dog was healthy with no problems? 2 days later we discovered that the dog was not Eating? She had teeth hanging from her upper jaw\nSpca told us that they will help with the $600 surgical cost over the phone. We took the dog back and we were told that we are not getting her back, they will conduct and investigation? And the adoption fee could go for the surgery cost? I Want my dog back!!! The rude lady behind the counter needs a little training in customer service and courtesy this is a service town not Salem......,"
1,"I used to go here regularly, but stopped... the kid who works at the front desk is a pain. He says there are appointments available, then says there aren't. I went in for my appointment, waited 30 minutes and then when I asked him what was going on he had an attitude, I don't mind waiting when I'm a walk in, but not when I've made an appt days before. The girls do a good job... if you can get in and they're not busy because they're great, they're busy because they only have two girls working the whole place."
2,Was aight... For Americanized Asian food.. I had the schezwan spicy beef noodle soup. My friend had the seafood noodle soup which she thought was ok too.  \n\nFor a restaurant in the Aria that's trying to cater to most of the asians who come to Vegas to gamble and party.. its an easy and quick alternative to getting a cab and going to the chinatown area of Las Vegas.\n\nThis is also one of the restaurants that is included in the list of comped restaurants in the Aria.
4,"Yelp reviews led us to this breakfast spot today.  No exaggeration, this was our best meal in Las Vegas.  Incredibly friendly service, fantastic food.  Nothing to look at, but when you dig into the gooey cinnamon roll you won't be able to pay attention to anything but your taste buds.  Holy cow.\nEggs were fluffy and not greasy.  Pancakes were equally fluffy, and flavorful.  Bacon was thick cut and cooked perfectly.\nI'm grateful this place is not local to me.  If I lived within 50 miles of this place I'd gain 50 pounds in a week.\nOh, and did I mention all this - two entrees, two drinks and a cinnamon roll made by the Tasty Fairy herself- all for $22.  It was their valentines day special.\nTreat yourself.  Worth the car rental to get here."
1,I've been there only once but the place is actually pretty small and the crowd is pretty young (around 18-20). \n\nThe entrance fee seems rather high for the place.
1,"I was there for a conference and I am a local. I didn't stay in the hotel but I was there for over 8 hours so I used the conference room and ate lunch there. The food selection was OK, but it is similar to other casino's. I ate at Metro Pizza. The reason for the low rating has to do with the conference room. The group didn't purchase a group wireless internet package so in order for us to get wifi, we had to purchase it on our own. Not usually a bad thing until I was told by their sales office that it is $24.95 for one hour and $80 for the day. Are you serious? My monthly high speed internet is only  $50 for the month. I was attending a conference and usually it is included or a nominal fee to get it, but $25 for one hour is ridiculous.  Stay away from them if you need wifi while on the premises. They do offer a basic wifi with the room but charge an additional $8 to get decent speeds. Caution if you need good wifi speeds."
0,"I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  \n\nHere are just a few things that I did not like: \n\n1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. \n\nThe bathroom was, in their own manager's words, \""disgusting.\""  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several \""clean\"" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). \n\nUntil this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was \""disgusting\"" and \""unacceptable.\"" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. \n\nI got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. \n\nLesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. \n\nThe housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. \n\n2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. \n\n3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western \""macho\"" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. \n\n4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi."
1,"Service? Here? Yeah right.\nI was seated in the middle of the main walkway. I could have asked to sit somewhere but I was short on time and needed to eat before I got on my plane. It would be awhile before I could eat again.\nI sat there for about 10 minutes while I watched them go take orders from other customers that walked in before me...and I was in their path. \n\nOrdered a burrito. \nIt arrived.\nTasted like a bland version of a Chipotle burrito....and I am not a fan of Chipotle.\n\nI was charged twice for my drink. Probably would have paid and not given it a second thought until I saw it later, but at $3.50 a soda. It was VERY obvious.\n\nNext time I'll eat before I get through security or try another concourse."
2,Great service by an attentive staff. Selection seemed a bit thin since last time I was here although a great alternative to the high priced casino options.
2,"Nice stadium.  Very clean but odd watching in a dome since the roof was closed when we were there (end of June and about 112 degrees outside). \nFood was only OK in my opinion, but there was a good variety."
4,"Perfect stay. Desk staff, restaurant and spa staff are all amazing, really friendly, helpful and accommodating, and seem to genuinely want you to be happy. Delicious food at ZuZu. Pool scene is fun and happy, even in sweltering July heat. Complimentary Red Flower soap, lotion, bath gel, shampoo and conditioner are fantastic. Don't hesitate to book this place."
2,"Five of us went to Bryan's for dinner.  The table agreed the brisket was by far the best thing any of us had.  It wasn't dry as one of the other reviewers mentioned, but it was incredibly tender.  The brisket is the only reason we gave it three stars.  \n\nI know barbecue can be pretty personal on preference but none of us liked the pulled pork at all.  We ended up throwing it away!  The beans were a bit spicy (which I liked others did not).  The coleslaw was average as was the chili.  I am told the ribs were also fine but not great, so really other than the brisket there wasn't much to rave about."
1,"It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats.  A little over priced for what you get as far as quality.  All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third."
2,"5 stars for the food. IT was absolutely amazing! The Sandbar had mac n cheese and it was utterly stellar!\n\nAs far as event organization....you had way too much open space and not enough shade. It was miserable outside. When I got my tickets I had planned to be there for 90% of the event. I ended up leaving after 3 hours, and that is after practically drowning myself to stay hydrated. Please plan shade better if you are going to have this event so close to summer next time."
0,"I'm only giving one star as I have no choice (that I can tell).\n\nHere's my story...\n\nYesterday we called to have food delivered.  After the experience I had, I wrote on their facebook wall.  \""They\"" wrote me back to ask if I had spoken to a manager about my experience.  This is my response back...\n\nYes I did but by that time, the csr Ryan had already upset me so bad, there was no going back. The guy was the rudest I've encountered yet. We are walking distance from the cutoff for delivery but was totally willing to drive up the street to Chandler Regional to pick up. He acted like he didn't want to do that but then said ok. Although he admitted he lives next to this hospital himself, he wanted me to give him the address for \""safety\"" reasons. So, I googled the hospital and gave him the address that was on the hospital website. He then argued that the address I had given him was not an address he had in his system from prior deliveries there... Kept putting me on hold (about 5 times) to check with his manager... I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \""you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\"". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me... He was rude! He was unprofessional. He was condesceding. I was willing to drive to freaken pick up the order although it's stupid not to drive one more block to deliver... Actually less than! I understand boundries which is why I was willing to compromise. I was in no way, form or fashion rude or even demanding with this jerk... Until, of course, he wouldn't shup up long enough to hear me... THE CUSTOMER! The manager who came to the phone was just as condescending. \""I will talk to Ryan...\"". No she won't! She was feeding him the information and he was speaking it to me, THE CUSTOMER, with her right there as there was no delay in him hanging up and her picking up. This behavior is so much more than unacceptable. We had had an awesome day as a family and was winding down and decided we'd order from there. His unprofessionislm and rudeness **** near ruined my night which in turned caused my family upset. I expect and will accept nothing less than professionislm when dealing with a company where I am a paying customer!\n\nNot only will I ever call them or eat there again, I will tell anyone who will listen to avoid this location, at the very least!\n\nAnd, of course, they haven't responded..."
3,"Went here for 2 days with a groupon.  The hotel is very easy to find, just off the freeway.  It  is very clean, modern looking.  We had a 2 queen room.  It was very clean, the bedding was so soft and the beds were very comfortable.  The bathroom was very clean, new fixtures great water pressure.  The pool was a lot of fun.  They have an indian restaurant there but we did not go there.  The breakfast was the only sour note.  Only eggs, toast juice and coffee.  Anyway, I would definitely stay here again.  It used to be a Ramada, but recently remodeled.  I loved that it was very modern looking and so clean.  The front desk personnel were very pleasant."
4,"I love the hot tri colored chips, taco Tuesday! Karaoke Thursday, Happy Hour from 3-6 and brunch on Sunday! Killer homeade margarita and my new favorite bartender, Vincanto, \""Vinny\"" made up the best Dulce de Leche martini. We loved the mahi mahi tacos, the carnitas and the guacamole! The place is so comfy, swanky, and very welcoming. I'm so happy that it's right across the street from home. Sorry Lindo!!!! Chinita's wins!!!"
1,Big rooms. Needs updating. Carpets were stained and torn in places.  Smelled a little musty. Pool overlooks an ally and dirty street. Room service slow. And they don't respond for hours if u need anything.  Service could have been better for the amount of money you pay. Overall an ok place to stay. But it's Vegas!!  There are hundreds of hotels to choose from. Why settle for less!
4,Definitely worth a visit!  I had the salted butter and nutella combo...wow it was good. I had never had butter ice-cream before and now I will seek it out.
2,"I'm not much of a golfer. In fact, I downright don't like the sport. But I've been to Callaway a few times to hit balls. For that purpose, Callaway is A-OK. The prices seem reasonable for a bucket or three. They even have a special right now (not sure how long it is intended to last) that gets you unlimited golf and range balls for $19. Now, I know my coworkers have experienced issues with the unlimited golf deal, but for the driving range, it sounds like a pretty good deal to me (especially if you somehow, magically share said range balls with friends)."
4,"Yep..I heard about these amazing red velvet pancakes and had to drag the family to that side of town and try em.\nOf course the hubby had to try the grilled cheese and FF. They off the fries seasoned which is nice. His sandwich was pretty ordinary but he was happy.\nI had the special which was a breakfast burrito and that came with 2 of the best pancakes EVER!!\nThey come with a small jar of cream cheese syrup and they are sprinkled with chocolate bits and a huge spoonful of whipped cream.\n1st the burrito..it was perfect. I had ham in mine since my little guy loves it and we were sharing. We both tore into it. It had just the right amount of cheese,potato,ham, and eggs. We ate the whole thing.\nNow onto the most wonderful pancakes in the world...\nOne word: YUMMY!!!!!\nGo get some NOW!!! These are amazing. Then do some serious cardio cuz god only knows how much sugar/calories there are in them.\nI also ate them both and did not share with the hubby or my baby!\nLOL\nIts a bit pricey..our bill was almost $24 bucks plus 5 buck tip. And it was on the other side of town. But I will drive here again  for THOSE pancakes.\nOh..service was also fantastic!"
0,"Why oh why did I go to Chinatown in Montreal!? My instincts said stick to French restaurants and places in Old Montreal, but nooooo, I had to come here. \n\nFirst off, after we were seated, it took the waiter about 30 minutes just to come over and take our drink order. That alone should have been our cue to get up and leave.The place wasn't too busy, so that was no excuse for the terrible service. After taking our order, it took them over an hour to bring out our food (I really wish I was exaggerating, but I'm not). We watched as large groups of Chinese people were seated and served before our food came out; it was absolutely ridiculous how they treated us. When we finally did get our food, it was fairly bland and tasteless. I don't think I've ever been so angry in a restaurant (I usually have great experiences since I started relying on yelp reviews) and I want to warn every person that they should avoid this place at all costs; there are too many great places in Montreal for you to waste your time and money here."
4,"We have used AZ concept for our Solar  Hot water and solar system.\n  I have read these reviews and what people forget about is that there are many company's out there selling solar.\n The utility companies are backed up three months or more. When ours was finally installed about 3months ,which we were advised of by solar concept. SR said they were sorry but it takes this long right now. After everything passed that day SR advised would be a minimum of 3wk before it would be turned on, was about 31/2wk This was of no fault of AZ CONCEPTS. They have been great to work with, when I had questions, they answered them for me.\n We are very happy with the SOLAR HEATER AND SOLAR on our home.   The installers that put the solar heater and the panels on our roof were very kind and courteous. You don't see that in workers today"
1,"If your namesake is wings, they should be awesome. And at BWW, the wings are merely mediocre. They do offer a wide range of sauces but nothing stood has stood out so far in my experience. They offer all-you-can-eat wings on Thursdays during lunch but their idea is to wait the customer out - we were there for 75 minutes with a very light crowd and we only got to re-fill our baskets (4 wings at a time) three times. That's barely passable service.\n\nIn terms of their drinking selection, BWW is really missing the mark. They understandably are catering to the sports fan crowd but to make it synonymous with only mass produced beer is terrible. There are so many craft options they could incorporate, especially local in Phoenix, and they really could do better if they aspire to be a go-to bar.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with BWW, there are just so many other good options, especially for their price point."
4,"For the first time, I am giving a fast food spot 5 stars. Why?? Because they exceed expectations every single time. \nHands down best customer service of any fast food place, every staff member is super helpful and polite. Also ending everything with \""it's my pleasure.\"" Now I am sure they are trained to say it, but it also seems like they genuinely mean it. \nHow many other fast food places come around to your table if you are dining in, and ask if you need refills on your drinks. None that I can think of, except for something like Showmars, which I categorize slightly differently that your \""typical fast food'.\nFood is always hot and fresh, I have never had an order messed up, can't say that about any other fast food.\n\nSo the moral of this review is, in a fast food world, this is a 5 star experience. 5 stars like a steakhouse downtown, maybe not, but they have earned their 5 fast food stars for sure. \n\nThanks Chick-Fil-A!!\n\nNow you just have to open on Sundays!!! lol"
1,Came here cause it was part of a package deal...They gave us free champagne...free is never good. Def not Dom :(((  \nWe got there early on a Friday night around 11:30 pm.  The girls drink for free at the bar...sky vodka only...but its free again.  The music is mixed house and hip hop.  Crowd is older 30-40 is mainly the crowd.  I couldn't wait to leave and go to XS!!
2,"Je m'attendais a mieux pour un resto indien dans le vieux Montr\u00e9al, les plats \u00e9taient excellents mais pour le reste j'explique.

0,"No stars-zero!The glass company M&M damaged my windshield.I inspected it prior to getting out of my car because the worker looked suspicious to me.When I stepped out of my vehicle,the Francis and Sons employee directed my attention to my back seat as he went through his sales pitch.As I was about to go into the waiting area,the sketchy M&M employee asked me if I had full coverage and directed me to the passenger side windshield where there was now obvious damage.It is very evident by the tiny hole in the middle if the fine size crater,that a sharp object was pushed or tapped in.I brought this to the attention of Sam the manager of Francis and Sons who immediately defended the glass company and stated how it's not any if his responsibility because they are a separate company.I called the police and while I waited, the manager of the M&M glass came to me and tried to say his employee could not have done it.He saud,\""If you were smart enough,you would know that it takes 80 lbs if pressure to do damage to that glass\"".I called the police.The Gilbert officer went into the Francis and Sons manager's office and viewed the video tape.He told me that the cameras point AWAY from the front of the vehicle.In fact,they point toward the street!he said he could not make a report because there is no proof or witnesses....I could go after them in law suit but he couldn't do anything.Nice little gig they have going there.Im sure they get away with it all the time.They could have done more damage or stolen something, be ware!"
1,"The most important thing to note about this restaurant is that the service is not good nor quick.  As others have noted, make sure you have ample time before your flight.  If you do, this is a great place to relax while you're waiting for your connection.   \n\nFood quality is not great.   I chose this restaurant over Burger King and actually regretted my decision afterwards.  Pluses are: the good atmosphere of the restaurant and the cold beer, which helps, especially when your plane is delayed by a few hours due to weather.  \n\nOverall. I rate this two stars based on the service and the food."
4,"While it is somewhat embarrassing to write a review on how good a donut shop is, I feel I must do it. Bosa is hands down the best place in the Valley to eat a donut. They're indescribably good. I've been to many of the locations and they all seem to be consistently good. The product they serve is outstanding and I have been ruined for all other donuts because of this funky little shop."
3,"Since I moved to Henderson I have been desperately looking for a quality pizzeria that delivers and I think I finally found it! I have sampled several different pizzerias over the last year and Mama Depalma's is the best.  Pizza was classic NY style, good thin crust, good tasting sauce, quality cheese, baked perfectly and delivered within an hour.  I can't wait until my next order."
2,"So I called Mamma Mia and asked about getting two large cheese pizzas and a cannoli for delivery to SkyPark and the youngish woman who answered my call to Momma Mia said that they won't deliver to SkyPark (literally across the parking lot) anymore so I needed to walk over and get my own pizzas, and also that because I had called the pizza place directly (and not had a SkyPark employee call in my order) they had to charge me a higher price for the pizzas!  WTF?!  \n\nExtremely annoyed I turned to the SkyPark employee, while still on the phone with the pizza place, and asked him why he didn't call in the order for me since I had to pay a higher price if I called them, and he just shrugged his shoulders, clearly unsure what to tell me.  \n\nSo after a few minutes I walked over to Mamma Mia where I explain I am there for the pizzas that I called in and I ask why I had to pay a higher price when the SkyPark staff were the ones to instruct me to call them directly, and the cashier immediately starts to go into this great rant about how SkyPark owes them money and they won't deliver pizzas to them anymore and blah, blah, blah...I couldn't believe it.  Mortified was the only emotion I felt.  \n\nSo I paid for my pizzas, checked in on Yelp, got my food and left.  It is worth noting that the pizza was good (flavorful, cheesy and hot) and I got the cannoli free for checking in on Yelp, but yeah, the general attitude from them sucked!  I'm never going back.  \n\n\nThere is never a reason to share dirty business laundry with your customers like that, it's very unprofessional!"
3,"5 Stars\nService:  Everyone was very friendly and answered all questions regarding the menu and details about the restaurant.  This is casual dining, so you order and sit down; however the staff came by our table many times to check on us and make sure we had everything we needed.  \nGrilled Pizzas: Holy crap, the grilled pizza was unreal.  We got the house made pesto pizza with bell peppers and onions.  The flavor was fresh, the dough was much lighter than any other pizza I've had and the portion was large enough for two people to get their fill.  \n\n4 Stars:\nAmbience:  I really like the set up, very reminiscent of Brixx's but still unique.  They have a bar in the middle, booths on one side, and a long wooden table in the front for big groups.  The second time my girlfriend and I went, they were projecting a video about Italy on a side wall (this seemed odd and the sound was off so it didn't serve much of a purpose).  \nMozzarella Wedges: I love it when restaurants serve wedges instead of sticks because they usually have more cheese in them.  They could certainly use a little more salt but they were very appetizing.\n\n3 Stars: \nTrue Traditional Pizza:  Maybe this speaks to how good our experience has been but this was the only thing about the restaurant that made me go \""ehh.\""  The pizza was good but it was very bready and the toppings were very light for $1 a topping.  The difference between this pizza and the grilled pizza was enormous.  I also felt like it was less food for more money.  \n\nOverall, I love this place.  I still want to try the oven baked pizzas and the home made gelato but I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh new pizza experience in South Charlotte.  It looks like they have a good local beer selection to so I am eager to try that one weekend.\n\nBottom Line: Get the grilled pizza!"
2,"Concord Mills constantly amazes me, and not just because it's the #1 tourist destination in NC, but because there are so dang many people there all the time (which I guess does contribute to that fact). It's like every time I go there, they have added another lane to some road or another. I guess those people have to get in (or out) somehow.\n\nAnyway, if I were going to visit Best Buy most times, I probably would not go to Best Buy at Concord Mills. But I happened to be there for some other reason, so we popped over, and you know what? It wasn't too bad. At least I wasn't seeing those ladies who have decided to wait 22 days to get a TV for $200.\n\nThe staff her is oddly hands-off, even more so than most Best Buy places, but that's a good thing - I don't like them to get too much into my face as I'm looking for stuff I can't afford. At least they give you a pretty convenient entrance to get in and out without having to mess with the rest of the mall traffic all that much."
1,"Oh Dickens... You can't utter the name of the place without shaking your head.\n\nIt looks exactly how you would imagine it on the inside. The only surprising thing is the locals. No shouting, no balling, everyone was strangely quiet (on a Saturday afternoon!!). The staff looked like they were going to slip into a coma at any point, totally disinterested at the world.\n\nNot bar of the year, but I doubt they care."
3,"always great stuff. I've been to better ones. But this one is pretty neat, good selection and excellent parking!"
1,"As mentioned below - and being as close as they are to the Phoenix megalopolis - they need to supervise the range very carefully - but even so, and as experienced as I am, the scene makes me very uncomfortable.  It can be very intimidating and a real turnoff to someone who is relatively new."
0,"Today I read a food critic's column in the Las Vegas Review Journal's NEON section which gave 4 A ' s to a new restaurant at Town Square, POT LIQUOR CAS. Wow, I thought! 4 A's. This must be a great place. So off we went to dinner with another couple with grand visions of a fabulous meal to come. This restaurant is far from fabulous, not 4 A's as described in the column. Not even close! The food arrived cold, the brisket was more fat than meat and not very tender, the ribs were dry and unappealing; the mac and cheese side was bland and had not a taste of cheese; one of my dining companions sent his brisket back in exchange for the pulled pork but, after arriving looking like half a football, it too was sent back. The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion. I gave this place a one star rating because the cornbread muffin was just ok and the water was wet! We eat out often and I've not ever felt so used and cheated."
2,Don't expect friendly service from the staff there.  The telephone receptionist is VERY rude.  The lanes however make up for the poor service.
4,"Best park on the west side of Vegas. I'm here all the time. It's good for younger toddler years also. Very safe. A lot of room and different toys to play on. Seems like it's well run and managed. The architecture, sand pits, and rope climber are all so unique. My daughter loves the snake and lizard statues. There's something for everyone here. AND a water park in the summer."
1,"The name Cardinal Pizza is sort of a misnomer for this (mainly) Latin American restaurant that specializes in Salvadoran and Nicaraguan food.  Yes, pizza is on the menu; however, when I went for lunch, I didn't see any pizzas being ordered.\n\nI spent part of my summer in Nicaragua last year, and I had some AMAZING papusas down there.  Since then, I've had a serious papusa craving, and when I saw the sign in the window, I figured I'd give them a shot.  While they got the basic idea, Cardinal Pizza's papusas aren't even close to the ones I had in Managua.  They're a bit bland, and the salsa and cabbage-like toppings weren't great, either.  Unfortunate, but live and learn..."
3,"These people are awesome.\nTip - if you're a GOLD member, go downstairs.  You'll wait upstairs for an hour!!!\nClean cars ready to go!"
1,Food was so bland. Everything was cooked really well and great portion sizes but overall the food was kinda flavorless.
1,"Ive only been to this place a handful of times, and I think tonight will be my last. The first few times we ate there I thought it was pretty good, but more recently I cant say the same. The food is fairly tasteless, the beans taste like they are out of a Rosarita can, and the rice could pass for TV dinner. Im not sure if this place is going down hill or what, but it was a little pricey for what we got. We ordered a chicken quesadilla, a shredded beef chimichanga that came with beans and rice and a small soda, it came to $22 and some change. Chips and salsa are complimentary. Call me cheap but I can think of many other places where I could spend that $22 that wouldnt leave me walking away feeling like I overpaid for not so great food. \n\nI will say the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. I wish for that reason I could give a better review but the food just doesnt quite cut it."
2,"Great staff but food unfortunately was lacking. Perhaps it just so happened that I ordered the \""wrong\"" dish (a rather mediocre Farfalle Alfredo) but I never enjoyed their butternut squash ravioli in the past either so...\nI will give them props for dessert though. The lemon tower cake was luscious and served with the freshest strawberries."
2,"Holy douche bag central!  It's places like these is the reason why I don't frequent Scottsdale too often.  It's full of douche bags.  The hotel is a trendy hotel and people like to be seen at trendy places.  I try to avoid them, but in this case I had no choice.  The rooms are really nice, but definitely not worth the price.  I mean it's Scottsdale people, not a mega metropolis where you can get these room rates.  Try to avoid the pool at all costs because it is full of meat heads and girls who are gold diggers.  But if that's your sort of thing have at it, because I don't want it!"
1,"I want to like Fate but I just don't. They cater to my vegan cravings so how bad can it be? But I just get a really shitty vibe when I walk in... Like it's sooo annoying that I want to eat there. This could all be in my head. I think everyone should try it for themselves. \n\nThat said, what's not in my head is the pricing structure of their drinks next door. Holy mother of chicken, Christmas and rice. Those are some pricey fuckin' drinks. The ambiance is cool but it doesn't justify it. Not to this wretched skank's soul."
0,"I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent. \n\nI gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.  \n\nThe scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.  \n\nMy 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.   \n\nWe ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).\n\nThe next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.  Instead it was shocking and put us in a bad mood because the El hefe staff refused to help with such a SIMPLE task. \n\nI don't think there will be a 3rd visit."
3,"Great sushi, I really haven't had anything else, I've been twice for lunch.  Very wide range of rolls to choose from, and the sashimi love boat is amazing!  Reasonably priced, clean, great service; highly recommended."
3,"After spending way too much on my hair cuts over the past few years at salons, I decided to go for the first time into a barber shop with the candy-twirling cylindrical thingy out front.  I had visions of old men getting their ear hair trimmed and getting their sides slicked down with Brylcreem.\nWell, this family-run place has its fair share of old men, but all the barbers have been cutting hair for a good number of years.  This place has weathered the Old Town recession because of good prices, friendly barbers, and decent cuts.  Although they are slowly changing the interior to be more sports-ish (they already have a few TVs on ESPN all the time), they still have the requisite late 80's male hair portraits (which give an uncomfortable gay-man is watching me vibe).  A few of the barbers give excellent shaves.  While two women of the family work there, they are also good at what they do.  My only wish for this place is that they get a few more bigger flat screens and take down those hair portraits because I have yet to witness a dude walking in and point up at the wavy hair of the guy in a popped up collar pink shirt and say \""that's how I want my hair\"".\n***Cash Only***"
0,"I called a psychic for a phone reading and boy, it was AWFUL. She basically asked my sign and gave generic attributes about it. Not worth the money.\n\nAlso, it felt very much like a \""Psychic Network Hotline.\"" Not personalized or warm at all."
4,Too bad but this shop has closed.  They were really good.  Now we do not have a real coffee shop.
2,"Small but cute. The wait staff was nice and the place is clean. Good pizza, pasta needed to be drained a little bit more but the marinara sauce was flavorful.  The place was real hot however.  Not too comfortable.  However, it won't stop me from trying it again."
1,"Well there is no food, beer, music, or anything else for that matter here.  Its the health office.  This is where you come to pay $50 to watch an hour long movie about washing your hands where they give you a quiz, but after the movie the instructor gives you all the answers allowing any average joe to come get their health card.  Get here at least an hour early before the scheduled movie time.  The waiting is ridiculous, but hey thats how government works.  Inefficient as possible."
3,"Topless vampire lesbians. Cloth dancers hanging from ceiling. Nunchuck/katana fights. Styx. Drunk dudes yelling obscenities at all the above.  Great performance by all. That being said, two of the erotic rock angels had the WORST boob jobs ever! NASA would have to invest decades in a bra to get those suckers back together again! Other girls were all gorgeous. Come sail away with this show. Worth the money if you're into topless vampires and 80's metal!"
2,"Just your standard diner.  Nothing special, but good food, salad bar, good size portions.  If your not looking for anything fancy, but just want to get something to eat it's the place to go.  Meatloaf dinner with mash potatoes and green beans, with soup or salad was $8.95.  Was hot tasty, maybe too much gravy."
2,"We went on Saturday night and this place was packed. Luckily I had made reservations beforehand. The bar area is pretty cool, but it and the dining area were so loud. We sat on the patio, which is covered and has fans and misters so we could actually hear each other talk. \n\nWe tried the date night special. It included 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 2 entrees and a dessert to share for $58. The AZ rolls were a pretty tasty appetizer, even though I had to pick the corn out of it. I enjoyed my WCG Bacon Blue Cheese salad. It would have been a lot better had they used spinach instead of mixed greens. The Caesar came with some nice big shavings of parm. Yummy. We both decided on the Parmesan Fillet for our main. The parm was a little overwhelming. We both pushed most of it aside, but the meat was very tender. My mashed potatoes started off yummy, but got pretty hard toward the end of the meal. We split the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert and it was pretty good, but we were so full we didn't finish. \n\nService was slow. We were here for almost 2 hours, but our waiter was very friendly. Everyone I know really likes this place so I think we may come back and give it another chance."
4,"American Shooters is a great place to purchase a firearm or shoot at the range. Very helpful and friendly staff. Made me feel very comfortable and confident in selecting a firearm. The range is very nice and clean, you can even shoot your own ammo."
2,"Wanted to find a place to buy tortillas since I moved here. When I seen this place off of Grand, I had to stop here and try it out! I bought two dozens of flour and corn tortillas, one pork, one cheese tamale, and a bag of tortilla chips! The only item I was impressed with was their chips??? Their corn tortillas was OK, nothing special! Tends to break apart while trying to eat it. Flour tortilla had no flavor, just pain piece of bread. Tamale was OK. I could name four restaurant you can get a better tamale at. So, I was happy with my chips anyway! great flavor, not to much salt. Being from SoCal, their were plenty of tortilla shops better then here, hopefully I can find another place to try?"
1,"Not all that good, unless you're drunk and cutting the rug, I guess.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in for lunch on a Sunday and it was a decent-sized crowd enjoying the nice weather. I perked up when the server told me it was happy hour. However, this is the lamest happy hour I've ever seen or heard of. $3 domestic bottles? What kind of happy hour is that? Who is charging more than $3 for a bottle of Bud Light even at the worst of times? And of course, I go through the normal shenanigans with the server as I ask for other bottles that are made in the US but somehow aren't included in the special. Fat Tire, etc. These are domestic, but no, you can't have them for $3.\n\nI order the carne asade tacos: $10, no rice or beans. No chips on the table. The meat is very sparse, and the rest of the taco is mushy stewed tomato. The tortillas are mushy as well, and there is a sad sprinkling of lettuce in the middle of the plate that would barely be sufficient for one taco, let alone the three that are on the plate. I took 2 bites and sent it back. My wife had a chimichanga which was OK. And by OK, I mean it's on par with what you might buy in the freezer at Safeway.\n\nOn the plus side, the server was really nice. So, yeah."
1,"First, let me say that most of the reasons this place gets only 2 stars has to do with my opinion that the whole Red Robin chain has gone downhill in recent years. The meat is not particularly tasty anymore and the bottomless fries are now served in a literally bottomless cup which is more of a hassle than it's worth. So it goes, I suppose.\n\nThere were somethings that I made this particular visit sub-par though. The restaurant was absolutely freezing. Even after our food arrived we had to ask 2 different servers for utensils so that we could have napkins. Were either of these things disastrous? No. But they were unpleasant and when coupled with the prior comments about the  food were enough to make me think twice about coming back."
2,"Long lines are typically a good sign of a solid food truck, but I think they might have been having some internal/logistical issues at the time. Ordered the chicken Mr. Bahn Mi-Yagi and was severely underwhelmed. Maybe their grill wasn't working 100% but the dog just about matched the air temp after our wait and the flavors left me wanting so much more. I felt like the small amount of radishes had more of a bite than the sriracha sauce did, which was really strange.\n\nMaybe the sun sapped my sense of taste but I felt like I had just eaten a truck stop wiener and not the gourmet experience I had been hyped to try for so long. I'd be willing to try again, but not that particular dog. The 3AM looked interesting, and the elotes locos dog looked really tasty, I think I might have just ordered their weakest offering in the bahn mi dog. Meh."
0,"Not sure what's going on with this restaurant. Had dinner there tonight and the place was practically deserted. They didn't have the wine we wanted and several items from the printed menu were not available. I had the ribs. They smelled great, but that's where it ended. The meat was dry and although the menu stated the dish came with sweet potato fries, guess what, they came with regular fries.\nThe bread pudding was good, though, and the waitress was very friendly, apologizing for every disappointment we faced.\nBut I would take a pass on this place, at least until they get their act together.\nBack to my first comment about the dinning room being empty: perhaps others have had similar experiences... Hope things improve in the future."
3,"They tend to have a great selection of conventionally grown produce (and, no, it's not really a farmer's market.. I wish!).  Their organic produce selection has grown in the past 5 years that I've been shopping here, so I think they'll only grow more with time.  They now at least have a section dedicated to O produce so you don't have to hunt around for it.\n\nOn Wednesdays, they have double-dip days.. meaning that the previous week's ads and the upcoming week's ads are active on the same day - double the deals!\n\nTheir meat section is decent - they always carry Organic beef and Organic chicken, and they have Lamb usually and Bison on occasion.  Of course conventional pork, beef, chicken, etc are always there. \n\nI would have to say the biggest pluses to this place are their bulk items - everything form choc chips to almond flour.. trail mixes... legumes... all kinds of nuts.. baking flours and even alternative snacks (apricots, dried currants, etc).  The other plus is the Vitamin section - TONS and TONS of options for all kinds of supplements, herbs, vitamins, whatever.. it's a great place to get cosmetics, too as they carry all the Alba, Avalon, Burts, Toms, etc.\n\nOccasionally they have the 25% off days for anything in the VItamins/Supplements area or from the Bulk section..  I go crazy up in this place stocking up!\n\nTheir wine selection is actually very nice for a grocery their size.  They tend to carry small batch vineyards at times and that's nice to grab on occasion.\n."
4,"Our second visit. Phenomenal sandwiches and baked goods. I had the Eggplant Grilled Cheese sandwich today - the best sandwich I've had anywhere in months. Wife had the Waffle, Eggs, and Ham sandwich with a rosemary bechamel sauce. Killer. We will be back....often!!"
3,"I too went to eat my first Cronut.  All they had left was coconut creme filling and guava filling, so I bought them up.  One of the cooks rang me up, and was very knowledgeable and pleasant as we spoke about the finer points of Cronut science.\n\nSo I guess it would make more sense to grade the components separately...\n\nCronut -- A: This was my cheat day, so what feels to be a 3000 calorie bomb tastes every bit as good as a 3000 bomb should.  Heavy, dense, and delicious.  Crunchy on the outside and chewy inside.  The texture and for the most part flavor was like nothing I had experienced before.  The two days it takes to make them is worth it, nice job guys.\n\nFilling -- D-: Real problems here.  First off, the flavor is nice, but very subtle.  I could only taste the coconut and guava when I had it on its own, and it was faint.  You just cannot put something with subtle hints of flavor on a full-flavor bomb like a Cronut.  You'll never taste it.  Second, the texture.  Both fillings had a runny, snotty texture that made an absolute mess all over the place.  Whether you eat it like a Big Mac, or you take it apart piece by piece and eat it that way, you can't escape it going all over the place.  Since it doesn't really taste like much anyway, I took a knife, scraped it off, and STILL managed to get it all over the plate and my fingers.  Magic stuff I tell ya.  For something so delicious, the experience as a whole really suffers because of this.  Such an easy fix, I hope they can figure it out.\n\nI'd definitely be willing to go back in a few months on another cheat day to try a different flavor and see if that makes a difference."
1,"Very disappointed.  Prices are high and the resort fee rubs you wrong.  We rented 2 rooms on the \""family plan\""', only to find the pricing on Expedia to be much better - to late, 3 day cancellation.  Both of our rooms had extremely dirty carpet, and one was supposed to be a suite.  How carpet gets that dirty on the 6th floor I will never know but I really don't think it's been shampooed in years.  Paddle boarding is $30 first hour then $20 an hour after that.  Food prices in all restaurants is very high with not many options off property.  This property does not live up to the westin name.  I wouldn't suggest anyone stay at this location"
0,"Forget this place, we came in at 2:45pm. They state that their restaurant closed at 3pm, but they kicked us out for no reason. No respect and they give no customer value. Change your damn closing time if you won't even work up to it. Pathetic. Thank god we didn't even go there. Their sushi sucks. Worst sushi in Vegas honestly."
0,"This is certainly not a French restaurant. The waitress didn't even know what brioche is, not that they serve it here. The brioche here is just toast.  The Corn Beef Hash wash cubed beef not hash and not very good.  The cappuccino was mediocre. Sour dough waffles, gouffles, nothing special. I wanted a souffle and my wife wanted a brioche. Neither were available. French, absolutely not.  Tourist trap, yes.  Never again for us.\n\nThis is Vegas.  I don't care if the food is pricey as long as it's good.  Don't waist your time here."
2,I like this place for some reason.  Cheap food and cheap room.  Thats all you need.  And also the fun zone downstairs is great for hours.  Pool sucks but this hotel is always fun.
2,"THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING BREAKFAST BURRITO -- The chorizo breakfast burrito is one of my \""treats\"" I allow myself occasionally and I have enjoyed them for years at this location. Unfortunately over the last year or so, this amazingly sinful wrap of goodness has deteriorated into an OK breakfast burrito. Less cheese, less egg, less chorizo (more potatoes) and probably 30% smaller than before. I understand everybody's gotta make a buck, but I probably won't be spending mine there anymore."
1,"This is not an exciting candy store and the stock looks old. The self serve candy bins offer a decent variety and you'll find plenty of Jelly Belly beans if that's your thing, but I've seen way cooler and more fun candy shops.\n\nI was specifically looking for some giant gummy bears and they had only 1 left, which wasn't that giant at all and it looked like it had been sitting there forever.\n\nThere's also a Bilboquet ice cream shop inside, with hard ice cream and sorbet to choose from but it looked messy and unappealing. Flavors are hard to read, scribbled on a chalk board. If you're looking for ice cream, there's a shop right across the street that will prove to be much more satisfying."
4,"Located off the strip, on the other side of the 15 freeway is the Palace Station Hotel. I have never set foot in this hotel/casino in my life until my friend told me that I need to go try the Oyster Bar here. Although, I'm not a big fan of raw oysters because of what it can potentially do to my bowels, I was assured that they have plenty of other (sea)food items to choose from.\n\nThe Oyster Bar is literally a horse shoe style bar (think shabu shabu). No frills, no tables, just a bar and stools. Everything is made, prepped, and served right in front of you. Because of this, be prepared to wait. It's worth it, trust me! Although we only had about eight people in front of us, it still took about an hour to get seated. Also, if you roll deep, expect to split up. This place though is opened 24/7. Maybe if you creep in around 4am then the line will be short unless all the drunken clubbers and strippers are present.\n\nIt seems like everyone has mixed reviews about the different food items here. Personally, the House Gumbo ($20) is the Royal Flush in my opinion. It's big enough for two people. The flavor will blow the socks off your feet. I had a New Orleans native with me and even she was impressed. I would come back and wait the long @$$ line just for this. I've been fantasizing about this gumbo ever since.\n\nThe jambalaya was my next favorite item we shared. It was a little bit runny at first but as the rice sits, it'll slowly soaks up the sauce. Another flavorful delight and massive in size.\n\nThe Seafood Pan Roast was good but it doesn't trump the other two items I sampled. It's heavily raved about, but I can go back to the Oyster Bar and pass it up.\n\nI like how each of these items was made right in front of us in these cool looking, silver/metal gadgets. It's hard to explain what they are so just check out the pictures or go there yourself and pay attention to how your food is being made. You'll be fascinated at how easy the chefs will make it look. Their secret is in the pre-made sauces of course. Our chef Blake was calm and collective even though he had a lot on his plate. Patrons were eagerly gawking at each dish he made, impatiently waiting their bite.\n\nFew suggestions: try not to come during peaked times. Share dishes and be aware that the portions are huge. Also, keep the party to a minimum unless you don't mind splitting up. Lastly, bring your appetite and taste buds because like watching Seigfreid and Roy, you're about to get mesmerized."
1,"Elliot's recently moved to the old Meadowview steakhouse location (much, much larger than the end of the strip mall where they used to be found, but still very close).\n\nI'm a fan of local, family-run business, especially ones that seem to be doing well.  If the business is doing well enough to move from the strip mall to the Meadowview, I'd say they are doing pretty well, so I'm excited.  Even though I ate their barbecue a few years ago and wasn't impressed, I figure it's time to try it again.\n\nWe went in on a Saturday afternoon, and the cavernous room was just about empty.  Seriously.  This huge room - outfitted to be reminiscent of the old building - had one other table with customers.  We spent probably ten minutes talking to the cashier and were not interrupted.  After we sat down, another couple came in.  That may not be a good sign.  But it's for another discussion.\n\nI decided that I would order a combo plate so that I could taste the barbecue and the brisket.  I've actually had brisket (in Texas, to be fair) that I loved, and I really would like to find someone in Charlotte who can do it justice, so I keep trying.\n\nThe brisket?  Nah.  It just isn't worth it, so don't bother.  The pulled pork is okay, but it doesn't have much flavor.  They do have some sauces that you can add, and they are okay, but nothing special.  The thing that really gets me is that their mac and cheese really has potential, it has consistency just like my grandmother used to make.  But again, it has no flavor.  It seems they used a bunch of actual cheese, rather than just using velveeta or something, but no mustard or anything else to give it flavor.  Shame, really.\n\nMaybe I'll check back again in another couple of years."
3,"My go to place to watch any game. You can always find dogs on the patio too. Service is great, but the food can be hit or miss."
4,"Great service, great price, great work and a quick response time. What else can you ask for? I highly recommend Chavez LawnCare."
4,"Wow, what a great experience. This was one of the few times I've been in a Sephora as I like make up, but never try new products, etc often! After buying cheap red lipstick bc I wanted to make sure I'd like the color, I decided I want to spend money on nice lipstick. Typically I'm a lip gloss low key lip girl. I went in and Jean was so incredibly helpful and fun with the shopping process. She gave me great tips on how to apply it, helped me pick out a great color which had all the 'color experts' saying how good I looked and went over all the different lipstick options with me. These ladies know how to make you feel good and sell the exact product you're looking for. I defiantly plan on going back when in need of another beauty adventure!"
4,"Yay!! I'm so happy I FINALLY found a groomer I like! Lilac was great with my two dogs and their haircut was beautiful. They were both nice and fluffy when I picked them up.. and the best part.. no knicks or razor burns anywhere! (This is a plus since I've had too many problems with other groomers in town) The salon was super clean and Lilac was very nice and accommodating. And if you check in on Yelp, you get $10 off!! Two thumbs up!"
4,"Everything was great.  Requested to split two entr\u00e9es and four separate plates came out...As requested, split entrees."
3,"The food is the star if the show here!  Don't get me wrong, the place has been remodeled and looks GREAT inside.  The dining area is totally separate from the bar so you can enjoy smoke free eating.  The ribs at $15.95 are a BARGAIN!  They have SO much meat on them.  You cannot and will not find better for the money ANYWHERE!  Not even Ellis Island.  You can't beat their quality and price.  For you cigar lovers, check out Doc's Cigar Lounge....On West Charleston, West of Valley View...Enjoy!"
4,"Best pancakes EVER! Enough said. Can't vouch for anything else though...so you're on your own. \n\nSeriously, if you find yourself in Las Vegas with a car or money in your pocket for a 4 mile taxi ride (against traffic so it's only about 10 minutes), then make sure to visit BabyStacks Cafe #2. It is well worth the visit and a good break from all the nasty cafe food on the strip!!!"
1,"It's mad busy here and donut was kind of whatevers.  If you're in a donut craze and desperate, then why not here?\n\nDrinks are expensive here.  If you want a soda or simple drink, go to McDonalds upstairs."
0,"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews and had a pleasant experience.  Good food, good service, good ambiance.  We came back here for Father's Day and had a very unpleasant experience; the worst display of management I have ever encountered!  Apparently our order was never put in from the server or there was some sort of \""computer malfunction' they claimed, but we waited at the table for 45 minutes after ordering, no food, nothing.  The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \n\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again."
4,"Delightful Diner!\n\n I've had breakfast at Toast several times, and every time the service has been fast and efficient. I've always enjoyed my meal, as did my boyfriend, and the prices are decent. Its a clean and cute little place, and the hours are very convenient. \n\n On one occasion, I experienced a small but ironic issue: the toast that came with my eggs was not actually toasted (at a restaurant named 'Toast')! I ended up pointing it out to our waiter when he came to give  the bill and ordered a bagel since I had eaten my eggs and was still hungry (great bagel, btw) and let it go. When the manager came to check on how we were doing he sensed my hesitation when I said everything was fine and he insisted I tell him what I was unhappy about. The manager sincerely wants everyone to be completely satisfied with their meal, and his genuine concern for my small issue made me feel like a valued customer (he discounted the bill and apologized for the ironic flaw). \n\nTry it for yourself. As far as breakfast places go, I think it's wonderful :)"
1,"Ok the food is worth trying I will give them that. But the way they lie and treat you the customer is just awful. We originally ordered catfish and they came back about 4 minutes later and told us they didn't have catfish. A customer walked in about 20 minutes after that and when the waitress said they didn't have catfish the big man that runs the place spoke up and said \""yes yes we do have catfish\"". I think he only told that customer they have catfish because he is biased. I am white and they didn't want to serve white people the good stuff it was only for their special guests or other black people. The waitress didn't smile once; when i asked if they had coca cola or dr. pepper she said \""NO!\"" in a very hateful tone and looked at me like i was scum. I felt like I wasn't welcome there the whole time I was there. Gave me the suspicious eye. Let's get rid of the prejudice people. We. Can. All. Get. Along. Anyways if your black, they will call you brother or sister and give you the royal treatment but whites should stay away unless you want shitty ass service."
0,"The service is AWFUL! the sloppy waiter made us wait for over an hour even though we had a reservation, and not only that, but he got other people who did NOT have a reservation seated before us!! he was walking back and forth to collect dishes and ignore us and not even apologize... \nafter we eventually got seated, nobody came to take our order for another half an hour... the food was not the best either.. everything arrived only luke-warm.. \nthe worst dining experience ever, all the waiter and waitresses are ignorant and slow slow slooow.. not going back...\nAVOID THIS PLACE!"
4,Starting off with a 5 we'got adeal on tickets after seeing show totally would have been happy with paying full price great show funny energetic !!! Great music and production
2,"***TIPS***\n\n- This is the closest location to the main vegas strip\n- Don't come between 10pm to midnight, you might have to wait 30 minutes for your food. Its faster to do drive through during these hours.\n- Go after midnight if eating there."
2,"I just got back from seeing the Misfits in concert at this joint. It seems smaller than the more well-known House of Blues out there in terms of 'small venues', although a bit bigger than the Railhead at Boulder Station.\n\nThe way the club is set up is kind of strange. There are two bars: one outside the actual stage area and one inside. Then in front of that is the pit and stage of course.\n\nSurprisingly, there's enough room to move around for moshing and crowd surfing. The security here don't seem to care if you start moshing, but if it gets too rowdy then they might stop you. If you're a repeat offender, they may kick you out.\n\nThe acoustics of this place sound very muddled, and I had a hard time deciphering what the band was singing. The instruments also seemed to blend together in a bad way. These are the only downsides to this joint.\n\nA lot of punk rock bands play here, and the week before the Misfits' tour was The Casualties along with Negative Approach and several other bands. LVCS seems to be the 'punk house' for the scene. Hey, that's cool--brings a little more 'arts and culture' to the downtown area, which is something that's badly needed besides First Friday.\n\nThis place should actually be renamed the 'Las Vegas Punk Saloon' since more punk bands play here than country ones. That, go pyschobilly/rockabilly if they wanna stay a little bit Country.\n\nI still think that bands should book somewhere else--the sound is just terrible, plus it's sort of hard to see the bands at times since the stage isn't raised.\n\nOtherwise, not bad for cheap tickets. You'll never find tickets here that cost more than $40. They're all reasonably priced, especially for the amount of bands you're seeing.\n\nP.S. the highlight of the Misfits concert was seeing Jerry Only get off the stage and French-kiss this punk rock chick that was directly in front of him. Mind you, Jerry's in his 50s now, and the chick he kissed seemed to be in her early-to-mid 20s or so. Just damn, man. Then again, I would still hit that no matter what age--Jerry is still hot to me."
4,"Home to good microbrew tap specials, the Hometown Sweethearts, and my upcoming new favorites, Brown Derby!  I find it both fun and relaxing to sit inside and have a nice, cold beer with good company and good tunes going on.  They have a good jukebox if there's no live music.\n\nOccasionally, the service leaves something to be desired, but I just pave over that feeling with more beer.  ;)"
4,"Marrow and crispy Brussels are a meal in themselves, and we almost canceled the burgers.  Wow, that wouldve been a mistake!  I luckily found my 2nd stomach... mussels were also good.   gin Richard, and  crimson tide were both really nice cocktails!"
4,"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch in town.  The Carne Adovada is perfection, and therefore I get it every damned time.  Tender, spiced, sauced porkwads with eggs and I believe breakfast taters on the side.  The spicy bloody is perfection.  I faintly recall the Jalapeno Eggs Benedict being yummy--whoever ordered it shared sparingly and guarded it with their life.\n\nThe joint is dimly lit, so you don't need to wear shades to nurse your hangover.  You sit in cushioned, isolated little adobe booths tucked away in corners--feels intimate to me and never loud.    The staff's always been really friendly.\n\nTen visits and going strong.  I'd be there right now actually if I'd run the prerequisite ten miles this week. :("
2,"2.5 starts for really crappy service!!!\nFor such a nice place, you'd think they'd have better service.  Holy frijoles, it sucked!  I went for the game night that Glenn and Bri planned.  I finally saw a guy walk by in a suit and said (in my not-so-quiet voice) \""I'll never come back here again.\""  He came right to our table with more Yelpers and said \""Are you guys the Yelpers?\""  I had to actually raise my hand, like in 3rd grade, the rest of the night to get refills on my drink.\nThe food was good.  Only good.  The crab cakes were AWESOME.  Huge hunks of crab, and only crab, coated with a light crumb and served on a sauce with REAL horseradish.  The fries?  Not so good.  Their only saving grace was that they were coated in Old Bay seasoning.  They were just normal shoestring fries, though.\nI really doubt I would go back just to eat.  \nThe ambience is really nice, though.  I just think that for a hotel restaurant, which in itself is in the HOSPITALITY industry, they'd have better service.  At one time, our server even changed color!  He said he was from Cuba.  I called him Fidel.  He laughed."
4,"The Monte Carlo is by far the best hotel for me. It's centrally located in the heart of the strip and despite the recent renovations next door, it still fits in great. I can't eat at any other cafe. Seriously, their food is so good. From their country fried steak to their chicken carbonara. So delicious! Any of their dishes appease any craving that I have. The dishes have always been cooked to perfection (except for the ONE time my hash browns were a little over-done, but it's cool). Other than that, nothing compares to their cafe for the price.\n\nTheir customer service has always been outstanding. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating. IF something does go wrong, they always do their best to fix it.\n\nFor those of you who enjoy gambling like myself, the MC is great. I'm a slotty gal so can't say much for the tables, but they have machines that range from $.05 to $5. Can't say the same for Aria next door. $10 video poker?! I ran right back to MC.\n\nThe rooms I have stayed in were always clean. I also tip the maids regardless if they come into my room during my stay. If everyone at least left them a few bucks to show appreciation, it'd go a long way. Oh yeah, tip the cocktail waitresses too. $1 a drink is my rule. It's just a classy thing to do.\n\nAll in all, MC is my #1 hotel in Vegas. Affordable, awesome food, friendly staff, and great for gambling. I tend to never leave MC because I'm usually disappointed with the other options. I love you guys!"
3,"I had expected this place to be a rather small museum, but it is actually quite large and is packed with artifacts and pieces from Native American tribes.  During our visit, we took a tour given by a Navajo student.  He was very knowledgeable and definitely kept everyone's attention with the information that he provided.  With the amount of exhibits on display in this museum, you can easily spend two or three hours just taking in everything that is offered.  There is a wide range of items on display from dolls to paintings to glass work to clothing and jewelry.  Another cool thing is that this museum allows you to photograph anything that you want."
2,"The good:\n\n* Beer specials - Each night there is a draft beer available in a 24 ounce mug for 4 dollars.\n* Wings - Try the spicy garlic. You can get them baked if you like it that way too.\n* TVs - Tons of them and booths have them as well. Always lots of sports on if that's your thing.\n* Bartenders - Easy on the eyes and usually friendly, unless you're a drunk/creepy guy.\n\nThe bad:\n\n* Waitresses - Usually overworked on busy nights, it can take a few minutes to be served or get another drink. Order a pitcher or a 24 ounce mug to avoid waiting long times between service, or if halfway done with a drink and the waitress comes by, order another drink early. Words to live by if you go to a busy bar/restaurant.\n\n* Music - Local music is more often a miss than a hit. Just be aware that sometimes it happens and if you can avoid it you should. Plus it takes away the shuffleboard and pool table area, so those won't be useable during a band.\n\n* Karaoke - I like a good round/night of karaoke but the nights they have it are usually pretty bad. Maybe I've just been unlucky and been there on especially drunken nights. Either way it was hard to sit through. (shots helped though)\n\n* Rowdy Sports Fans - Sometimes things get a bit crazy here during big games, so be prepared if you go on such a night. Big cheap beers and really excited sports fans sometimes means a super loud and occasionally obnoxious environment."
4,"What a terrific meal!  We loved the menu from the pate, to the beef carpaccio, to the scallops, everything was well prepared and tasty. Make sure to order the brussel sprout side, it was amazing!"
4,"Penn Ave Fish (Downtown) is one of my favorite places for lunch takeout.  And it's not a measly few orders.  It's usually around 20 orders including soups, specials, and sushi (all different)!  We call around 11:15a to place the order and they can usually have it ready within an hour.  And more times than not, the orders are perfectly prepared, not forgetting one soup!  \n\nWhen we pick up, the line is usually out the door, so I'm sure it isn't easy to get a large order correct during the prime time lunch rush.  Inside is small, but the chatter and blue iridescent tile d\u00e9cor give it a lively atmosphere.  \n\nThe Ronnie Roll is my favorite! Don't let the bright yellow soy wrap scare you!"
3,"This is my favorite car wash in Las Vegas.  It's the type where you drive through the automated washer cave inside your car  and then when the cave spits you out your get out and the washer boys vaccuum the inside of your car, shine the wheels, put armorall on your dash, etc. The staff here are so friendly and helpful, both the oil change staff and car wash. They all seem so grateful to be working here which is refreshing.  When I got my oil changed (this gets you a free car wash) it was finished in 20 minutes and I went on a Sunday at about 10am!  Bravo!"
3,I absolutely love this place.  Very large selection of very good cigars.  The drinks are fantastic and there is actually a very large selection.  I initially went to this place to purchase cigars as there are some only available at the shop.  My friend and I decided to grab a drink as well.  We got the tangerine mojitos and they were fantastic.  The eye candy at the place is also fantastic.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars really is that it can get incredibly cramped at the front tables.  The price of the drinks were fair for where and what they were.  However some of the cigars were on the bit pricey side which makes sense considering the availability of some of them.
4,"We took the greyhound to Montreal and was looking for brunch places near the station. This place has a great selection of food, from Egg Benedict to Crepe/Waffles. Most of their service staff only speak french and the menu is in french, this can be inconvenient but could also be part of the great experience!"
3,The green tamales were delicious. i walked to the Steamed Tamale because\n i work just  2 minutes away. By the time i got back to the office needless to say the tamales were gone. Worth the trip and reasonably priced. Owner/staff were very friendly. I hope they stay around.
1,"My friends and I happened upon this place on the way to our hostel and, being from Southern California (and therefore having quite a bit of experience with Mexican food), we were so taken aback by a Mexican place in Scotland that we just had to try it. It's a fine attempt, but ultimately misses the mark. My blended margarita didn't taste good, and my beef tacos were a bit over-the-top. The food isn't bad if you're desperate, but I don't think I would go there again."
4,I'd never been here before but it was a great experience.  We saw Avenue Q in the Hormel Theatre.  It's very small and intimate - great place to see a show.  We had excellent seats but I suspect just about every seat is a good one.  Looking forward to coming back!
1,"Went here friday night for dinner with hubby. We had not been here for a few years and we were excited to try it again. We wanted to love it... But found everything to be just ok... Kinda disappointing. Service was slow, even though it was not that busy (our first clue we \nProbably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back... Even for free meal!"
2,"Ask anyone in town who is a local where to go eat steak, and invariably this place comes up. Walk in the place, and you may have to check to see if you are in the right place. When I first walked into place back in 2005, I was miffed as one side of the place is the dive-st looking bar, and the other is the steakhouse. We turned around and walked out, but after hearing for years how good this place is, I had to go back. \n\nGo here if the steak is important, and the aesthetics are not. If you are looking for a much nicer LOOKING place, then go to Delmonico's, not far away. Everyone I ate with at the Tornado loved their meal (2 steaks, one fish), as did I. Champagne Dan, bartender extraordinaire and food lover to the max (@ the Concourse Hotel - Shout Out to CHAMPAGNE!) recommended either the Venison, or the Flank steak, which he claimed is the owner's favorite. I got the venison, accompanied with a side of hash browns, which may sound strange, but they were damn good and crispy. Haven't eaten much deer in my day, but it was pretty good. \n\nBottom line - if you want steak, here is your place."
4,"At 10:30pm i was craving this : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/H8qpFitIesth86zqR4cwYg?select=t-ZAZpB7Uu2tdh_Wl2VRuA\nCreme Brulee Gelato. They close at 11pm, so from Paris hotel, we hauled ass to Bellagio to get my fix. The alluring sight of the chocolate fountain art was still accompanied by a line of people ordering last minute crepes and cakes. Ordered my gelato in a waffle cone, and about 8 bucks later, i was a happy MT.  If i stayed at the Bellagio or Aria, i know i would have a dozen check ins stocking up on breakfast pastries, chocolate snacks and late night desserts! Danger!"
1,"This is a medium sized all you can eat sushi and Asian food buffet.  We went during \""Happy Hour\"" where the price is only $11.95 per adult.  Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\n\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\n\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.  It's been years since I had to worry about this food additive.  Although my headache was not bad, I don't need this experience again.  Go only if MSG doesn't bother you."
2,"The service could use some improvement.  This restaurant is understaffed and unable or properly handle peak times.  We were told there is no wait, but  ended up waiting for 20 minutes for a table.  Proper service at the bar is also lacking.\n\nOn the bright side, the beer selection is good and the food is pretty tasty.  If you're willing to wait and don't mind poor service, give this place a try."
3,"Just like In & Out Burger,  \""keep it simple and they will come\"".\n\nI though my sandwich was small but I could barely finish it, it was dense with meat.  I got the Cheese Steak and I must say it's close to one of the best I've had.  Next time I will get the Bobbie, look up the website and the menu.\n\nI can't wait to go back......"
4,"Wow! Shocked that I was able to call in for a last minute check-up as a new patient and they were able to see me in 15 min...\n\nThis vet is very close to where we live, so I think we found our new vet. All the staff was super friendly - - which is typically the case of any vet office. \n\nBut yes, I agree with the other reviews - - nice, organized, clean, and large open environment.\n\nLucy had a nice first visit today. :)"
3,"My second visit was MUCH better than the first.  The General Manager /staff/server made every effort to make sure we had a wonderful brunch for my mother in laws 85th birthday.  I will say that the General Manager contacted me after my first yelp review and told me to contact him when in town to give the restaurant another try.  As a small business owner, I was totally impressed with this personal touch.  It also resulted in a very pleasant second meal at Morels.  \n\nWe dined inside on this visit, and that was a very pleasant experience.  Nice, crisp, clean dining room with lovely paintings (of a sexual nature!) on the walls.  It was relaxing and enjoyable.\n\nMy husband and I shared the fried prawns, and they were DELICIOUS!  I loved the basil dip that came with it and saved it to go with my frites.  YUMM.  I ordered the steak frites, which was very good....even better with the dip (or pistou as the menu calls it).  \n\nWe had a lovely bottle of champagne to celebrate our great meal.\n\nI will happily return in September for brunch when I am at my yearly conference in Vegas."
0,"The restaurant was empty an hour after the football game. This is a bad sign. We waited 30 min for our food. Our food was cold. One member of our party did not receive his meal with the remainder of the group. When the group complained the server said \""the cook is new and is messing everything up.\""  We paid for our drinks and left. Worst service ever. Horrible food. Several other parties walked out as well. Do not waste your time. Walk across the street to Gordon Biersch."
1,"Must say one of the worst buffet I had. The foods had limited favors, not much of a selection and please don't try their Pho! Dessert I must say was great."
3,"The best homemade tortillas in Scottsdale!! Located in a historic adobe home in Old Town Scottsdale.  Dishes include ancho raspberry-encrusted pork chops and Shawnee sea bass with a cheese and rock shrimp quesadilla, topped with shoestring sweet potatoes. The banana crisp wrapped in a sweet tortilla with blackberry compote is out of this world."
0,"Rude front desk person, horrible experience.  The girl cutting/styling my hair wanted to send me out with just dry hair, no styling. I asked her to please style it and she gave me high school pin curls of some sort with 1/2 can hair spray.  I asked for a blow out, you know round brush?  Awful.  The \""free manicure\"" was just a polish change since they don't cut cuticles so what's even the point? She also ran out of time since it took 2 1/2 hours to trim and style my hair.  No thanks. Go to Paul Mitchell or Aveda Institute."
0,"We stopped by here prior to going to a Cirque show on our first night in Vegas.  I made reservations for 5 so I expected to have a table ready at that time.  Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\n\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \""Spago\"" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \n\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \n\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either. This is just not worth your time OR MONEY...there are better restaurants out there for competitive prices.  Nothing to see at this establishment but they are clearly enjoying the benefit of being inside the Forum Shops.  Don't say you weren't warned..."
3,Looks like Marie Calendars again... so glad!  missed the pies
4,"The starter they offer is fresh chips and salsa and it was AMAZING, I haven't had fresh salsa like that since I was in Texas! \n\nI would definitely suggest you visit this restaurant if you're at the NY hotel, we got the enchiladas and they were the best I'd EVER had (better than when I was in Mexico)! The menu has an excellent variety of Mexican food and the pricing is excellent for anyone on a budget. The portions are also very well sized (enough to share and be full). \n\nABSOLUTELY A MUST WHILE YOU ARE IN LV! :D"
0,This place has really went downhill. Really nothing open at all only whole foods and a couple other stores and 3 restaurants. I think if they did something to this place and add more stores like pacsun and NIKE and other teen and men stores then this place would be better
3,"$2.50 pints all day, good food, lots of TVs.   A good find in my neighborhood."
0,"WARNING!! They do not take responsibility! $1500.00 car wash. My truck had a tiny crack in the side plastic panel that makes up the entire rear side . It was underneath and not noticeable, at first glance.  Someone at this location did notice it, so he put a piece of tape on it, because he was concerned about more damage. He DID NOT WARN ME! I would have not gotten it washed! After the damage was done he came in a got me and showed me what they had done. So my $20.00 was more important to them than my truck. They are refusing responsibility. The GM  \""Tiger\"" would only refer me to the sign that says that they don't take responsibility. I hope this crappy business gets everything they deserve. I am not done pursuing this. Look out Tiger, if I have my way you might lose your Christmas bonus!"
3,"Mabels feels almost like a speakeasy; some forgotten 1920s haunt, dimly lit and awkwardly tucked away off of the main drag in Old Town Scottsdale. It is run efficiently by capable, friendly staff who genuinely enjoy chef Aaron May's fun cooking and who know how to pour a drink.\n\nUp until this point in your life, you've likely never tried a deviled egg burger: a burger lovingly prepared with a smattering of delicious deviled egg, with a perfect bit of cheese all on a wonderful english muffin of sorts. This simple fact needs to be remedied: try one at your earliest convenience.\n\nIt will get everywhere, as the burger is too big for its britches, and the deviling helps not a bit with cleanliness, but the flavor is fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail brings about a very few (four, I believe, in my case) enormous shrimp, but at roughly $2.25 a pop, I don't think I'd repeat, though the cocktail sauce is delightfully prepared and the shrimp are as big as your fist.\n\nThe bar is wonderful and eccentric, and on Tuesdays, you can attempt to stump Chef May. Though I haven't tried yet, it sounds like a world of fun in its own right. Better still, they pour heavy, which is good as the cocktails can run in the $7-$14 range.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is subdued; you almost hope it'll be smoky each time you walk in. The stamped tin roof is fun and the penny-floor is a quirky touch in the men's bathroom. And don't forget to ask about Moby Dick. \n\nA good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu, but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks. The happy hour, though frustratingly placed in the middle of the work week, is an amazing deal and I might just have to try to convince the office to abscond one Thursday."
4,"I love them here.  Always been a great experience.   Best doctors ever, very caring.  Wouldn't go anywhere else!!!!"
0,"Don't even think about eating here...I ate here twice, once for the dinner buffet and the other time in their restaurant for breakfast.  In both cases the atmosphere was depressing, the food bland and tasteless, the servers, absolutely superb.  I have never seen servers/waitresses more upbeat and friendly, it's a shame they are given such a poor product. One waitress in particular when I commented on the food just rolled her eyes, she seemed to immediately understand exactly what I was saying. There was a waitress in the restaurant where I had breakfast, think I heard she was 68, and I told her that she was 100 times better than the food, and that says it all.\n\nThe buffet selection is poor, the ceilings are incredibly low, the food is bland, it's just a yucky atmosphere.\n\nI actually like the hotel, you can find some incredible rates for staying there on i4vegas, just don't eat there.\n\nHas to be one of the most depressing buffets I've ever been at in Las Vegas.  Seriously, you don't know me, but in this instance, \""trust me\"".\n\nGo elsewhere to eat, even for breakfast, no matter how cheap it is.\n\nYuck."
2,"Wow, an AM/PM that doesn't slam you with fees for using a debit card! Nice. This location was clean, well stocked, but also a bit of a pain to get in and out of. Still this was the first AM/PM store I've visited in the entire Vegas valley that I would go back to. (If Quiktrip ever expands out of Phoenix they would wipe the floor with this place, but I'm just dreaming. At least it's better than any Terrible Herbst location!)"
1,"Having read the reviews and checked out the menu and decor in person before deciding on it, I could not have been more surprised to have such a disappointing experience.  \n\nThe wine by-the-glass list is inexplicably short, but the options are decent.  The view of the fountains is great at certain tables.  We were not at one of those tables.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n-  Crispy Eggplant (chef's special appetizer): tasty, but oddly dry.  Served with an overly dusty coating and no sauce.\n\n-  Hot and Sour Soup:  All hot, no sour, with an unwelcome sweetness.  They took it off the bill, though.\n\n-  Kung Pao Chicken:  Bland in taste and texture, with large, flat medallions of tough chicken and super-sweet cashews overpowering any hope of a savory note.\n\n-  Braised Kobe Short Ribs:  Stew meat served on a gelatinous bed of noodles oozing some kind of thin brown liquid.  Tasteless and unappetizing for everyone at the table.\n\nWe were far too disappointed by this point to try dessert.  Plus we were both still hungry, so we left and got chili-cheese fries at Snacks on the casino floor.  Now THOSE were really good!"
2,"Didn't get a chance to try the restaurant, we were here for the bar/lounge scene. We paid $20 to get in and have free drinks the whole night, so that was a plus. I'd say this is one of those places where you're better off splurging on bottle service, because that's the only way you're going to have any room to dance and not bump into anybody. The DJ was decent, no one special, just spinning the latest Top 40 tracks. I enjoyed the crowd, which was a plus as I spent most of my time there smashed up against them as I was dancing. I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here during my next trip to Vegas and trying the cuisine!"
4,"Can I just say that I miss the Chai lattes here???  Mo-fo's is the only place I know of that uses ACTUAL tea to make these, and not that crappy syrup. I'm ruined for any other Chai experience...RUINED. Someone find me a respectable chai on the west side, please!"
