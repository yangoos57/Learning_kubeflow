"Stopped back by Mellow Mushroom with my mate Justin from Brew Bros. & a few of our mates Monday afternoon while pub crawling on a day off.  \nFirst I must say my return trip was motivated by an immediate response from to my 1st Yelp review from Mellow Mushroom's owner Jay.  I didnt expect any reponse, much less a return so quickly. Respect for that. Great to see to someone paying such close attention to their customers.\nThis can only be a good thing.\nThe same draft selection as the first time around.  48 Handles.  Thats a lot of beer.  As said in my first reiview, with 48 handles I would Love to see more variety and a bit more imagination with respect to the draft beer choices, then again who would complain about a selection w/ at least 40 craft beers on tap?   Thats a real commitment. \nOur bartender Madison was enthusiastic about what she was serving which in Arizona's growing craft beer community is a big plus.  On a another note, this time around the food I ordered made it out of the kitchen rather quickly.  Just a mediterainan salad, but nice.\nAll said, great to see another craft beer brother join the club.  Nice to have you here."
